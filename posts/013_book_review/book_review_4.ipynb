This includes informing any decision making, verifying information correctness, and increasing creativity and productivity.

Specifically, it talks about how techology is becoming increasingly intertwined with these legal systems including law and regulations. Additionally, it mentions how AI may lead us to rethink and refactor our existing human systems because of outdated beliefs and ethics. The chapter once agains gives an example of how AI and humans can work together to improve society as a whole.\n"
