    "**ChatGPT:** That sounds really heavy—and lonely. You’re noticing not only a kind of emptiness in yourself, but also projecting that sense onto the people around you, which must make it feel even harder to connect. Almost like everyone’s faces become hollow and there’s no anchor, no solid ground to hold onto.\n",
