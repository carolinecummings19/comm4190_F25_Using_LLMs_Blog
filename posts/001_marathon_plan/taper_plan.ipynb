    "## Using ChatGPT 5 to Fine-Tune My Marathon Taper\n",
    "\n",
    "With six days left before my marathon, I wondered how I should spend these days. I had just finished my last long run — a speedy 12 miles — and knew that the real challenge wasn’t fitness anymore. It was execution. Tapering is one of those strangely emotional phases for runners: you finally get to rest, yet you also worry that resting too much will make you sluggish.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, I turned to ChatGPT 5 to help me shape a taper plan that fit not only my training history but also my preference to **run as little as possible** during race week.\n",

    "I gave ChatGPT my recent training log — everything from my two 20-mile runs to the pacing and heart rates of my last couple of weeks. I wanted to give it the context it needed to specify when and how fast I should run. \n",

    "The plan it returned was simple and runner-friendly: 3–4 miles six days out, a couple of optional short runs, and rest days built in. The focus was on rest, glycogen replenishment, and mental calm. Honestly, it was validating to see a taper that matched my intuition.\n",
