    "\n",
    "Ever since I ran the Philadelphia Marathon, I have not been running very much. At first, it was because I was recovering, and then I became really busy wrapping up the semester. And now that the semester is done, I have lost much of my motivation to run and want help finding it again. I wondered what are some things I could implement during my winter break that will help me gain my motivation back? I will have a lot of unstructured free time and want to get back in shape for my next marathon in March. \n",

    "## 1. Reframe running as *play*, not training\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now your brain still associates running with structure, discipline, and obligation (long runs, workouts, plans). That’s a motivation killer after a marathon.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For 2–3 weeks, ban the word “training.”**\n",
    "Instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Run **without pace goals**\n",
    "* Pick routes based on *vibes* (river path, quiet neighborhoods, trails)\n",
    "* Let runs be anywhere from **15–40 minutes**\n",
    "* Stop early if you want—on purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps your nervous system relearn that running ≠ pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Create a “bare minimum” rule\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivation often comes *after* action, not before it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Set a rule like:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “If I put on running shoes and step outside, I’ve succeeded—even if I walk back in.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Or:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 10 minutes total\n",
    "* 1 mile max\n",
    "* Out-and-back so you can turn around anytime\n",
    "\n",
    "Ironically, once you lower the bar, you’ll often keep going.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Add novelty (your brain is bored, not tired)\n",
    "\n",
    "You’re someone who thrives on projects and iteration—your brain wants *new inputs*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **New running gear** (shoes, socks, cold-weather layers)\n",
    "* **New format**: fartlek by feel, trail runs, point-to-point routes\n",
    "* **Audio novelty**:\n",

    "  * Only allow a certain podcast *while running*\n",
    "  * Audiobook you’re genuinely excited about\n",

    "\n",
    "You’re very reflective—use that.\n",

    "Try one of these:\n",
    "\n",

    "  * What surprised you?\n",
    "  * What felt meaningful?\n",
    "  * What didn’t matter as much as you thought?\n",
    "* Write a **“why I run” note** that’s *not* about races\n",
    "* Scroll back through Strava memories and note what made runs feel good\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivation often returns when you remember what running gives you *emotionally*, not competitively.\n",

    "## 6. Temporarily detach from race goals\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t need a “next race” right now.\n",

    "Instead, use soft goals:\n",

    "## 7. Cross-train in ways that support running (without forcing it)\n",
    "\n",
    "If running feels heavy, support it indirectly:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Strength training 1–2x/week\n",
    "* Mobility or yoga\n",
    "* Easy cycling or long walks\n",

I don't think I normally use the word training very much in my day-to-day life so probably wouldn't benefit from the reframing of the phrase. However, I think the general sentiment of not thinking of running as training but as something more enjoyable would be beneficial. \n",

I will be home most of winter break so will try to run in new places to add some excitement and something to look forward to. My dad also enjoys mountain biking so will ask him to go on rides so I can incorporate more cross-training in the next month or so. Additionally, I will focus on being consistent which I think is the most important thing for me to regain. "

Usually, they recommend to log 40-60 mile weeks by running 5-7 times a week, which is not super feasible to me. I enjoy the flexibility of this plan and the gradual ease into the intensity of runs. By talking with it previously about my low motivation and describing my past running experience, I think it was able to provide an adapted running plan for me. \n",
