    "## Testing Coding Skills of a Local Model\n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted to test the coding skills of this local model because I had only ever used the frontier models, which are very good at coding. Similar to the tutor task, I asked the model to teach me about the comparisons of Python and Java, including writing snippets of code. I tried to stay very specific so that the model wasn’t asked for too much output, because it takes a lot longer to produce its response than a cloud-based model.\n",

    "The model went over four key points including **data storage**, **access time**, **resizing and performance**, and **use cases**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model only covered Python in the data storage section, stating *“lists are implemented using a hash table structure”* but did not compare it with Java, which was a little disappointing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It stated **O(1)** access time for both Python and Java and mentioned that the **LinkedList** in Java has **O(n)** access time but efficient insertion/deletion. It also said both resize dynamically when elements exceed current capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "It further claimed Java provides performance advantages because of lower-level optimizations. Finally, it discussed the use cases for each language — highlighting Python as being easy to use while Java is better when high performance is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I wasn’t too impressed with its responses as they were a bit repetitive and not as robust as I was hoping for.\n",
