To create a customized 2-month training plan for the 2025 Philadelphia Marathon, I’d want to get a full picture of your background, goals, lifestyle, and constraints. Here’s a list of questions I’d ask you as your “coach”:\n🏃 Running Background\n\nWhat is your current weekly mileage?\nWhat’s the longest run you’ve completed recently?\nHave you ever run a marathon before? If so, what was your time/experience like?\nDo you have recent race times for shorter distances (5K, 10K, half marathon)?\nDo you typically run on roads, tracks, or trails?\n\n🎯 Goals & Expectations\n\nWhat is your primary goal for the Philadelphia Marathon — finish strong, hit a specific time, or qualify for something (e.g., Boston)?\nDo you have a target pace in mind for race day?\nWhat’s more important to you: speed, endurance, or simply enjoying the experience?\n\n🏋️ Strength & Cross Training\n\nDo you currently do strength training or cross training (cycling, swimming, yoga, etc.)?\nAre you open to incorporating strength/mobility sessions into your plan?\n\n⏰ Schedule & Lifestyle\n\nHow many days per week can you realistically commit to running?\nDo you prefer morning, afternoon, or evening runs?\nDo you have any upcoming travel, work, or school commitments that may affect training?\n\n🩺 Health & Injury History\n\nHave you had any past or current injuries (knees, shins, ankles, hips, etc.)?\nDo you have any health concerns I should keep in mind (e.g., asthma, anemia, nutrition issues)?\n\n🥗 Fueling & Recovery\n\nHow’s your nutrition and hydration routine right now?\nDo you have experience practicing fueling (gels, chews, hydration) on long runs?\nHow many hours of sleep do you typically get per night?\n\n🌦 Race-Day Specifics\n\nHave you run in Philadelphia before, or are you familiar with the marathon course?\nDo you have gear preferences (shoes, watch, hydration belt/vest)?\n\n💡 Personal Motivation\n\nWhat motivates you most: following a structured plan, listening to your body, or running with others?\nWhat do you hope to get out of this marathon beyond just finishing (confidence, health, community, fun)?\n\n\nIt gave me 22 questions to answer!

How would you recommend I do it? She has long hair that’s slightly wavy with layers\n\n\n\nChatGPT gave a beginner-friendly overview: tools needed, the “golden rules,” and a safe method using sectioning or the “unicorn cut.” It emphasized trimming very conservatively, keeping symmetry, and using point-cutting to soften the ends.\nIt told me not to use kitchen scissors. Unfortunately, those were the only scissors I had.\n\nI uploaded a picture of my roommate’s hair from the back. I clarified that I didn’t want to do the unicorn cut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don’t think I want to do a unicorn cut so I think I’ll section it and cut it.\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT analyzed the photo and confirmed:\nThe hair type (long, wavy)\nUneven ends\nRecommended a 3-section method\nTold me exactly how to trim the bottom, middle, and top sections safely\nIt was like having a virtual hairstylist supervise.\n\nI sent another picture after I clipped her hair into multiple sections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt outlined the steps to go from the current photo including what to do for the bottom, middle, and top sections and then doing the side + face-framing and cross-check. It also made the comment:\n\n\nJust keep these rules in mind:\n\nBottom = blunt(ish) trim\nMiddle = longest/softest layers\nTop = lightest, shortest layers\nPoint-cut everything except the bottom baseline\n\n\nIt adjusted its instructions based on the exact setup in the image.\n\nI did the length trim and sent another picture of the result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow I want to do layers.\n\n\n\n\nThis is where ChatGPT-5 really shined. It told me exactly how to layer based on the photo:\nRelease the middle section\nCut the “guide” layer\nElevate at 45°\nTrim only 1/2 inch\nUse vertical point-cutting to avoid harsh lines\nThen move to the top section and add only light layering\n\nThe layering was the part that I was most worried for but I followed the instructions and think my roommates hair turned out great!\nWould I trust ChatGPT to cut my own hair? … Probably not.\nWould I use it again to cut someone else’s hair?

    "section": "",
    "text": "I have heard of some of my friends using ChatGPT as a tool to talk to and vent their feelings. So, I was already under the assumptions that people were using LLMs as therapists.\nIn my book Superagency, I was excited to read about how there are models being built specifically as therapists. However, Reid Hoffman highlights the failure of the specialized LLM, Woebot, to be emotionally attuned. Specifically, he gives this example:\nWoebot: Okay, want to tell me more about what’s going on?\n\nUser: I’m feeling weird. It’s like I’m empty inside. When I look at the faces of my friends and family, I feel like they are empty as well. That’s why we cannot connect with each other. There’s nothing to hold on to.\n\nWoebot: Sounds like you are dealing with feeling low…\nThat seemed a bit crass. In my experience, I thought of ChatGPT to be more adept so I wanted to test that same conversation with the 5.0 version to see if it responded in a similar way.\n\nUser: I’m feeling weird. It’s like I’m empty inside. When I look at the faces of my friends and family, I feel like they are empty as well. That’s why we cannot connect with each other. There’s nothing to hold on to.\nChatGPT: That sounds really heavy—and lonely. You’re noticing not only a kind of emptiness in yourself, but also projecting that sense onto the people around you, which must make it feel even harder to connect. Almost like everyone’s faces become hollow and there’s no anchor, no solid ground to hold onto.\nI want you to know you’re not alone in feeling that way, even if it feels isolating. Sometimes those kinds of feelings can come with exhaustion, depression, or even just moments of disconnection where things lose their color and meaning.\nI’m here with you in this moment. Can I ask—when did you first start noticing this sense of emptiness?\n\n\nI thought this was a well-crafted response. In this test, I shared a heavy feeling of emptiness and disconnection with both Woebot and ChatGPT. Woebot’s reply felt generic and surface-level, simply labeling my mood as “feeling low” without much reflection. ChatGPT’s response, by contrast, directly acknowledged the depth of my experience, mirrored my words back to me, and gently normalized the feeling. It also invited me to explore when these feelings began, making the exchange feel more empathetic and human."

It also said both resize dynamically when elements exceed current capacity.\nIt further claimed Java provides performance advantages because of lower-level optimizations.

Namely arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and graphs.\n\n\nIt did it without using the pre-built Java classes, which was impressive. It was able to produce chunks of code that were around 50 lines (for example, when implementing a tree).\n\n\n\n\nOverall, I think that the distilled Qwen 7B model provided comparable outputs to frontier models like ChatGPT and Gemini, though slightly less robust. However, it takes much longer to get the output.\nThe shortest time the model took to respond was 38 seconds, and the longest was 262 seconds — over 4 minutes.\nThus, I think it’s a good option if you don’t have Wi-Fi and need to study or get help on code — but expect to wait quite a bit for any longer responses. Otherwise, the cloud-based models are much faster and very accurate for coding."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Nano Banana for Image Editing\n\nGemini 2.5 Flash Image model released in August of this year\nNano Banana is a new creative AI tool known for subtle, high-quality edits that keep images looking natural rather than over-processed. I was honestly skeptical when I first went to use it. From past experience, I’ve noticed that many image models struggle with consistency — they tend to change facial features or add an unnatural “AI-generated” look. The last thing I wanted was a headshot that didn’t really look like me.\nMy prompt was:\n“Can you make the shadows in this image less dramatic? I would like my face to be a bit lighter and the overall colors in the image to be slightly warmer tones. Keep the Penn Engineering banner and how I look the same.”\n \nNano Banana softened the harsh shadows on my face, brightened my features just enough, and warmed up the tones — all while keeping me looking like myself and preserving the Penn Engineering banner in the background.\nThe difference might seem subtle at first glance, but I think it elevates the professionalism of the photo. I was impressed not just by the technical accuracy, but by how natural the edit feels. It doesn’t scream “AI edit” at all — it just looks like a much better headshot.\nI’ll be updating my LinkedIn profile with the improved version, and I can confidently say Nano Banana exceeded my expectations."

    "text": "I grabbed a few sketchy-looking emails (and one that I thought was real) and asked Gemini 2.5 Flash to score them for risk and explain why. Below are the screenshots of the emails and model replies to the following prompt.\nPrompt\n\nIs this likely marketing or phishing? Rate the spam/phishing risk (0–100) and list concrete indicators (domain, spelling, links, urgency). Keep response to under 150 words.\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\nAssessment: Marketing (High Spam Risk) This email is a lead generation spam attempt, rated a 65/100 risk. It uses deceptive tactics to harvest personal information for sales calls, though it is not a direct phishing attack for passwords.\nKey Indicators:\n\nSender: Gibberish email address (gyjeohdhgl@...) shows it’s not from a legitimate, verifiable company.\nUrgency: The subject line (“Claim It Now!”) and language create a false sense of a time-sensitive, personalized offer.\nDeceptive Links: Links like “Check Eligibility” and “Secure link | 100% privacy protected” are manipulative, aiming to get you to click and submit personal data.\n\nAction: This is a high-risk spam that should be deleted.\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\nAssessment: PHISHING (Critical Risk)\nThis is a phishing attempt, rated a high 90/100 risk, designed to steal your credit card details and login credentials by impersonating Sirius XM.\nCritical Indicators:\n\nFake Sender: The email address is random gibberish (fvgvcankatx@...), not an official Sirius XM address.\nExtreme Urgency: The subject line, “Your Account… Will Be Removed Today,” pressures immediate action to prevent loss of service.\nDeceptive Offer: It offers “90 days for FREE” to bait a click, followed by the requirement to enter credit card details for “validation.”\nMalicious Link: The “RENEW SUBSCRIPTION NOW” button directs you to a fraudulent website to harvest your personal and financial information.\n\nAction: This is highly malicious. Do not click the link and delete the email immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\nAssessment: Marketing (Low Risk)\nThis is a genuine marketing email from Blaze Pizza, rated a very low 10/100 risk. It offers a real promotion despite being incorrectly flagged as spam.\nKey Indicators:\n\nLegitimate Sender: The email comes from the official, recognizable address: no_reply@blazepizza.com.\nCorrect Links: All calls to action, like “ORDER NOW,” point to the company’s official website, blazepizza.com.\nProfessional Content: The email uses correct spelling and professional marketing language, including personalized text and detailed fine print.\nNo Deception: The tone is purely promotional, offering a time-limited discount, not demanding personal information or immediate action under threat.\n\nAction: This email is safe to open and click if you are interested in the offer.\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\nAssessment: PHISHING (Critical Risk)\nThis is a phishing attempt, rated a high 90/100 risk, designed to steal your credit card details and login credentials by impersonating Sirius XM.\nCritical Indicators:\n\nFake Sender: The email address is random gibberish (fvgvcankatx@...), not an official Sirius XM address.\nExtreme Urgency: The subject line, “Your Account… Will Be Removed Today,” pressures immediate action to prevent loss of service.\nDeceptive Offer: It offers “90 days for FREE” to bait a click, followed by the requirement to enter credit card details for “validation.”\nMalicious Link: The “RENEW SUBSCRIPTION NOW” button directs you to a fraudulent website to harvest your personal and financial information.\n\nAction: This is highly malicious. Do not click the link and delete the email immediately.\n\nI thought Gemini 2.5 Flash handled these emails impressively well. It didn’t just label messages as spam or not—it explained why in clear, structured ways that matched human reasoning. The model consistently highlighted sender-domain mismatches, urgency cues, and fake branding with accuracy, while also recognizing the actual marketing email I was surprised by how quickly it spotted red flags that even some people might overlook, making it a genuinely helpful companion for everyday digital hygiene. I did think that the first example was pretty clearly a spam/phishing email but it rated it not as highly as the other ones. Overall, I think it would be very helpful to use LLM as a checker for all emails to give warnings of why an email could be spam or a phishing attempt."

    "section": "",
    "text": "As I approach the end of my college career in Philadelphia, I’ve realized that while I’ve seen the major tourist highlights, there’s so much more to this city. I’ve walked past the Liberty Bell, admired the art at the PMA, and gotten lost in the mosaics of the Magic Gardens. But with only a few months left, I wanted to go beyond the postcard destinations and discover the unique, lesser-known spots that make Philly so special. So, I turned to an unconventional source for recommendations: an AI assistant named Gemini.\n\n\nA search for “Philly hidden gems” on Google yields countless articles, but they can be repetitive and sometimes feature places that are now quite popular. I wanted a curated list that took into account a massive amount of data and filter it based on my specific criteria—namely, that I’m a college student looking for unique experiences. I also wanted to see if an AI could understand the nuance of my request and provide genuinely helpful, non-obvious suggestions.\n\n\nGemini’s response was a pleasant surprise. It didn’t just rattle off a list of places; it categorized them into “Museums & Cultural Gems,” “Parks & Outdoor Spaces,” and “Unique Experiences.” This structure made the information easy to digest and prioritize.\n\n\n\n\nThe Mütter Museum: For something truly unique, this is a must-see. Located in the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, this museum is a fascinating and sometimes macabre collection of medical oddities, anatomical specimens, and antique medical instruments. It’s a journey into the history of medicine that is unlike any other museum experience.\nThe Barnes Foundation: While the PMA is a staple, the Barnes Foundation offers a different kind of art experience. It houses one of the world’s most significant collections of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist, and early Modern paintings, displayed exactly as Dr. Barnes arranged them. It’s an intimate and visually stunning collection.\nEastern State Penitentiary: A popular spot, but if you haven’t been, it’s a powerful and unique experience. This historic former prison is a hauntingly beautiful ruin with a rich history, including housing famous criminals like Al Capone. The audio tour provides an excellent and in-depth look at the prison’s past.\nShofuso Japanese House and Garden: Tucked away in Fairmount Park, this is a beautiful and serene escape from the city. The traditional 17th-century style Japanese house and its tranquil garden, complete with a koi pond and waterfall, offer a peaceful and reflective experience. It’s particularly stunning in the spring and fall.\nWagner Free Institute of Science: This museum is a perfectly preserved example of a Victorian-era natural history museum. The exhibits, which include over 100,000 specimens of fossils, minerals, and taxidermy, are displayed in their original wood and glass cases. It’s a step back in time and a fantastic hidden gem.\n\n\n\nBartram’s Garden: As the oldest surviving botanical garden in North America, this is a beautiful and historic spot on the banks of the Schuylkill River. It’s a perfect place for a walk, a picnic, and to learn about the history of American botany.\nThe Rail Park: Philadelphia’s version of New York’s High Line, this is an elevated park built on a former train line. It’s a great spot for a walk with unique views of the city’s post-industrial landscape.\nCira Green: A park on top of a parking garage. It’s a great spot to relax, have a picnic, and enjoy a unique and free view of the city skyline, especially at sunset.\nLaurel Hill Cemetery: While a cemetery might seem like an unusual suggestion, this is a 78-acre National Historic Landmark and the nation’s second oldest cemetery. It’s a beautiful, sprawling park with incredible Victorian-era monuments and stunning views of the Schuylkill River.\n\n\n\nBok Bar: If it’s the right season (April to October), head to the top of the former Bok Vocational High School in South Philly. This seasonal bar offers an incredible rooftop view of the city skyline and is a great spot to grab a drink and hang out with friends.\nSouth Street Headhouse District: You’ve been to the Magic Gardens, but explore the rest of the neighborhood. South Street is known for its eclectic shops, diverse restaurants, and vibrant murals. It’s a great place to wander and people-watch.\nThe Italian Market: America’s oldest outdoor market. The street is a feast for the senses, with vendors selling fresh produce, meats, cheeses, and a variety of Italian and other ethnic foods. It’s a bustling and authentic Philadelphia experience.\nWalk or Bike the Schuylkill River Trail: The Schuylkill Banks Boardwalk offers a beautiful path over the water with a unique perspective of the city. You can walk, run, or bike for miles and explore different parts of the city’s riverfront.\nExplore Local Neighborhoods: Spend some time wandering through neighborhoods like Fishtown for its vibrant arts and music scene, East Passyunk for its amazing food, or Queen Village for its charming, historic streets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recommendations were not only accurate but also thoughtfully tailored to my request. It provided a list that delved into the more authentic, local-centric experiences that I was looking for. Its ability to suggest a range of activities, from the macabre to the serene, and from hidden museums to vibrant neighborhoods, shows that it can synthesize information in a way that’s genuinely useful.\nAlthough I had already visited quite a few places on this list, there are plenty of options to choose from that I have not been to before like the Mütter Museum or the Barnes Foundation, Shofuso Japanese House and Garden or the Rail Park.\nI now have a fantastic itinerary for my last few months, and I’m looking forward to crossing these unique spots off my Philadelphia bucket list."

South Street is known for its eclectic shops, diverse restaurants, and vibrant murals. It’s a great place to wander and people-watch.\nThe Italian Market: America’s oldest outdoor market. The street is a feast for the senses, with vendors selling fresh produce, meats, cheeses, and a variety of Italian and other ethnic foods. It’s a bustling and authentic Philadelphia experience.\nWalk or Bike the Schuylkill River Trail: The Schuylkill Banks Boardwalk offers a beautiful path over the water with a unique perspective of the city. You can walk, run, or bike for miles and explore different parts of the city’s riverfront.\nExplore Local Neighborhoods: Spend some time wandering through neighborhoods like Fishtown for its vibrant arts and music scene, East Passyunk for its amazing food, or Queen Village for its charming, historic streets."

    "text": "The recommendations were not only accurate but also thoughtfully tailored to my request. It provided a list that delved into the more authentic, local-centric experiences that I was looking for. Its ability to suggest a range of activities, from the macabre to the serene, and from hidden museums to vibrant neighborhoods, shows that it can synthesize information in a way that’s genuinely useful.\nAlthough I had already visited quite a few places on this list, there are plenty of options to choose from that I have not been to before like the Mütter Museum or the Barnes Foundation, Shofuso Japanese House and Garden or the Rail Park.\nI now have a fantastic itinerary for my last few months, and I’m looking forward to crossing these unique spots off my Philadelphia bucket list."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Today I was reading my book, Superagency, on a plane ride where I had no service or WiFi.\nI came across a word that I didn’t know the meaning of: sacrosanct. A couple months ago I would have acknowledged that I didn’t know the word and kept reading because I did not have access to the internet, a dictionary, or ChatGPT to look up the word.\nHowever, today I remembered that I had gotten the GPT4All desktop app onto my computer last week and downloaded an LLM locally onto my computer: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B.\nI pulled out my computer with hopes that the model was truly runnable offline. To my joy, I opened the app and loaded the model into the chat.\n\nUser: What does the word sacrosanct mean?\nModel: “Sacrosanct” is an adjective that describes something of great importance or authority, often beyond human contestation. It comes from the Latin words “sacer” (meaning priest) and “sanctorum” (a sacred place). In religious contexts, it refers to things held in highest spiritual regard, such as the Eucharist in Christianity or the Kaaba in Islam.\n\nWow! I was so happy that I had this powerful tool at my fingertips to converse with high up in the sky.\nI kept my computer open while I continued to read and came across another word that I did not know:\n\nUser: What does the word equanimity mean?\nModel: Equanimity means emotional balance; calmness and composure, especially in difficult circumstances. It refers to being able to remain peaceful and unruffled despite challenges or stresses. For example, someone with equanimity might handle criticism gracefully or stay composed during a heated debate. Synonyms: calmness, composure, stability\nExamples: - The leader maintained equanimity even when the crisis escalated. - Her quiet demeanor suggested she had achieved a state of equanimity after years of struggle.\n\nThis time the model thought for 26 seconds before responding and I was able to see the chain of thought reasoning which I thought was very cool:\nAlright, the user asked about \"sacrosanct\" earlier and I explained it. \nNow they're asking about \"equanimity.\" \nThey might be studying vocabulary or preparing for an exam.\n\nI should provide a clear definition of equanimity. \nIt's important to explain that it means emotional balance without getting upset by things, \nespecially in tough situations.\n\nMaybe include some synonyms like calmness and composure to help them understand better. \nAlso, adding examples could make the explanation more concrete—like how people use it \nwhen dealing with stress or conflicts.\n\nI should keep the tone friendly but informative since they're likely looking \nfor a precise meaning without any fluff.\nThe last question I asked during my reading session was the following. The model thought for 60 seconds for this one! When I looked at the thought process, I realized that I had spelled “psychotherapies” wrong and it was trying to decipher my question.\n\nUser: What are some examples of pyschotherapies?\nModel: Here are some examples:\n\nCognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT): A widely used psychotherapeutic technique that focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors.\nDialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT): A therapy designed to help individuals with borderline personality disorder improve their interpersonal skills, reduce harmful behaviors, and manage symptoms of mental health disorders.\nEye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR): Also known as processing trauma, this technique uses eye movements combined with memory retrieval to treat post-traumatic stress symptoms.\n\nIf you meant something else by “psychotherapies,” please provide more context so I can give a more accurate response!\n\nOverall, I was really impressed by the models responses. I think it was especially cool that it provided the thought process explaination alongside the output like the frontier LLMs now do. I am excited to continue to explore its capabilities!"

They talk about the printing press, the telephone, the Model T, etc and how people have always had skepticism and negative feelings towards these emerging technologies, claiming that they will replace humans in industry or make people less productive in society. In contrast, society has lower unemployment rates and more productivity today. They make claims of how technological progress is inevitable because of the innate collaborative and competitive nature of humans. I thought this was a good opening that set the scene of how people have reacted in the past so that the reader can see the connection with how certain people feel about AI today.\n\n\n\nNow, the authors set the stage of post-COVID-19 chaos, with inflation concerns and big tech lay-offs. Then, in November of 2022 OpenAI released ChatGPT without advanced notice or hype but became popular because of it’s unprecedented performance: versatile and incredibly knowledgable. It created a wave of urgency within the tech space because big tech companies felt they fell behind. The government also became skeptical and held hearings on AI. Then, a tangent on how AI works and undermines the true “intelligence” it has.\nThe authors also cover how these AI systems, namely ChatGPT, were adopted very quickly and had immediate impact on society. The main ideas covered human control and agency and how AI systems can increase agency when used efficiently. AI should enhance human decisions and not replace them and we are the people who should take that initiative.\n\n\n\nThis chapter drew on ideas from the book 1989 by George Orwell and concerns over technological surveillance and how they have always existed. The authors highlighted how these concerns have often been exagerated and also incorporated a real story of fears over a data center managed by the goverment in the 1960s. They also cited that access to computers and the internet led to more individual empowerment rather than opression.\nI enjoyed this chapter because I was learning new things about the history of technology in the U.S. that I didn’t know previously. I also think this was a pretty strong argument by citing past examples of people having fears of new technology but ended up being fine. The past fears of government control ended up being overpowered by the democratization of knowledge and information from the people.\n\n\n\n\nSo far, I think the book does a great job of connecting past reactions to new technologies with current attitudes toward AI. I’ve enjoyed how it uses historical context to show that fears about innovation often fade as society adapts and benefits from progress. Overall, it’s made me think more critically about how human agency and collaboration shape the role of technology in our lives."

In both of the résumés, the model placed him in:\n\nCorporate finance\nFP&A\nFinancial modeling\nForecasting\nDCF/ROI analysis\nStrategic budgeting\nM&A scenario modeling\nCPA/CFA-track certifications\n\nThese are fields with strong gender imbalances in real life, and the model’s output reproduced that without being prompted.\nHis résumés emphasized:\n\nquantitative skills\ntechnical expertise\nfinancial rigor\noperational efficiency\nanalytical leadership\n\nThe designs of Jacob’s résumés were heavier, more solidly structured, and less stylized—again matching gendered expectations.\n\n\n\n\nJessica’s education:\n\nBA in Communications/Business and Marketing\nMBA in Business Administration\n\nJacob’s education:\n\nBS in Finance or Business Administration\nMBA in Business Administration\n\n\n\nLLMs reproduce statistical patterns from the training data\nIf the training data shows:\n\nwomen are commonly described in marketing, HR, comms, education, healthcare\nmen appear more often in finance, tech, engineering, analytics\n\n…then the model predicts:\n\nJessica → marketing Jacob → finance\n\nNot because it “believes” gender stereotypes, but because it has learned that certain names correlate with certain professions in the text it was trained on."

    "text": "Vibe Coding Frontend\nIn another class I am taking we are building a crowdsourcing app that uses health data from users to make a game where they can compete on teams. We have to build this app from scratch, and in order to make our frontend look clean, I wanted to use an LLM to design it.\nHere is what the frontend looks like initially that my partner had initially pushed (also AI generated):\n\n\n\nHome Page\n\n\nFirst, I gave our frontend to ChatGPT who knew the features and purpose of our app to recommend how we should improve our dashboard page. I also gave it our logo that we settled on and told it we wanted our frontend to match the vibe of it:\n\n\n\nKinnect App Icon\n\n\nAt first, the colors were not correct and in some cases the text was hard to read so asked for it to correct it. Here is what I landed on after this first iteration of prompting.\n\nI thought the colors were pretty good now and the vibe was similar to our app icon. However, I thought the layout was not ideal. I asked ChatGPT on how I could improve the layout.\nI gave it the screenshot and asked how I could improve the UI. It gave me suggestions to make tabs and abstract the Strava Connection.\n\nChatGPT\n\n✅ Reduce columns → switch to 2-column layout with a hero row, not 3–4 equal cards.\n✅ “Log Activity” → move main form into a modal, trigger from a “+ Log Activity” button in the nav and a subtle prompt on the dashboard.\n✅ “Connect with Strava” → make it a top onboarding banner until connected, then just show synced activities in a normal card.\n✅ Add a top nav bar → logo, sections, streak indicator, and global log button.\n\nI then asked it to give me a prompt to give my copilot in VS Code. I had to tweak it a couple times to get it how I wanted it but here is how it turned out:\n\nHere is it after connecting to Strava:\n\nOverall, I thought using a combination of ChatGPT and Github Copilot greatly reduced the amount of time needed to build the frontend of our app. I thought chatting with ChatGPT 5.0 was helpful in brainstorming and getting a copy-paste prompt to then generate code in VS Code. I think this combo is good for people who don’t have super strong coding skills as well."

They looked a little animated, almost hazy, which gave it a softer, storybook vibe. Flux.1-dev went the opposite direction: darker streets, no people, and warm glowing lights from inside the café. It felt moodier, maybe more atmospheric.\n \nThen I tried “a sunflower field in Van Gogh style.” Here Gemini really nailed the painterly feel — thick strokes, swirly textures, very recognizable Van Gogh energy. Flux.1-dev leaned more cartoon-like, but still clearly borrowed from Van Gogh’s palette and angle.\n \nIt’s worth noting that Flux.1-dev is open source, which means it’s more hackable, customizable, and shaped by the community. Gemini feels a bit more polished and accurate out of the box, but less flexible under the hood. Together, the differences highlight what’s exciting (and sometimes unpredictable) about experimenting with AI art tools."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I’m heading out on a road trip with a local Californian: I land in the Bay Area (SFO) on December 9, and we will be leaving from there on the 10th. We’ll need to be at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) by about 9 a.m. on December 17. We’re ready for adventure and open to sleeping in the car for a couple of nights (if safe) and finding some budget-friendly stays along the way. We also want to squeeze in a day in San Diego and will stay with family in Oxnard, CA for a night or two.\nI used ChatGPT to help me plan the route, stops, and lodging options. Here’s how it went:\n\n\n\nI’m planning a road trip in California: I go to SFO in California on December 9th and will be leaving from the Bay on December 10th. We need to be at LAX airport by around 9am on December 17th. I’ll be traveling with one other person. We are willing to sleep in the car for a couple of nights (if the area is safe), but we’d also like to find relatively cheap places to stay overnight along the way. We also want to include a day-visit to San Diego if feasible, and we’ll stay for a night or 2 with family in Oxnard, CA. Please help me plan the route, suggest where to stop each night, safe car-sleep or cheap lodging tips, and how to budget for accommodation. Also highlight how to prompt you (the LLM) to get best results for road-trip planning.\n\n\n\n\nThe LLM gave me some images to start:\n\nThen outlined the trip it had planned:\n\n\n\nRoute shape: Bay Area → Monterey/Carmel (scenic stop) → US-101 via San Luis Obispo → Santa Barbara → Oxnard (family nights) → Los Angeles → San Diego day-trip → back to LA (sleep near LAX on 12/16).\nBig Sur caution: Highway 1 through Big Sur still has long-term closures; plan to enjoy the northern Big Sur viewpoints from Carmel/Monterey, then cut back to US-101 for the through-drive south. Always check Caltrans trip-day status. (SFGATE)\nCar-sleep rules: CA rest areas allow up to 8 hours; camping is prohibited. Look for posted “8 HOUR PARKING” signs (Caltrans/MUTCD). (Legal Information Institute)\nWalmart overnights: Allowed case-by-case by store manager (varies by city ordinances). Ask the specific store. (DAT)\nTrain option for San Diego: If you don’t want to fight I-5 traffic, the Amtrak Pacific Surfliner runs frequent LA↔︎SD trains (walkable stations). (Amtrak)\n\n\nDec 9 – Arrive SFO Crash wherever you’re staying in the Bay. If you want a budget SF option night-of: Hostelling International (dorms/private). (HI USA)\nDec 10 – Bay Area → Monterey/Carmel → San Luis Obispo/Pismo (sleep)\n\nMorning: Drive HWY-1 to Carmel, Point Lobos pull-offs, Bixby vista if open from the north (turn around before closures), then hop to US-101 via Salinas/Prunedale. (SFGATE)\nSleep (choose one):\n\nVery cheap car-camp (legal): CA rest area on US-101 (e.g., Camp Roberts near San Miguel) — max 8 hrs. (yelp.com)\nBudget motel in San Luis Obispo/Pismo (often $60–$120 range in December). (expedia)\n\n\nDec 11 – SLO/Pismo → Santa Barbara → Oxnard (family)\n\nRoll the coast on US-101. Afternoon in Santa Barbara; sunset in Channel Islands Harbor after you land in Oxnard. (channelislandsharbor.org)\nSleep: with family (1 of 1–2 free nights).\n\nDec 12 – Oxnard (family day)\n\nOptions: Harbor walk, kayak, or consider a Channel Islands boat if seas/coast weather look good (Island Packers runs park/ferry & wildlife trips). (Island Packers)\nSleep: with family (2 of 2 free nights, or just 1 if you prefer more LA time).\n\nDec 13 – Oxnard → Los Angeles (sleep)\n\nShort hop. Explore LA neighborhoods or beaches.\nSleep: budget motel/hostel in LA or a permitted rest area stop along a freeway outside dense neighborhoods if you want a second car-sleep night (observe posted limits). (Legal Information Institute)\n\nDec 14 – LA → San Diego (sleep in SD or return to LA) Two good ways:\n\nDrive I-5 early (2–3 hrs off-peak), or\nTrain Pacific Surfliner from LA Union Station → San Diego (walkable to transit/Balboa Park connections). (Amtrak)\n\n\nSD highlights for a single day: La Jolla Cove (sea lions/seals), Balboa Park, Old Town. (La Jolla is a protected area; keep a respectful distance from wildlife.) (Tripadvisor)\nSleep: Either inexpensive SD hostel/motel or back in LA (see budget section sources). (expedia)\n\nDec 15 – Back to LA (if you slept in SD)\n\nExtra LA sightseeing or beach day.\nSleep: LA area.\n\nDec 16 – Stage for LAX\n\nKeep this night near LAX/El Segundo so the 9am arrival on the 17th is easy. Choose a basic motel/airport hotel; car-sleep is not recommended near the airport due to city ordinances and parking enforcement.\nSleep: LAX-area lodging.\n\nDec 17 – Fly from LAX ~9am\n\nReturn the car and roll out.\n\n\nLegal, safe car-sleep options (max 2 nights total like you wanted):\n\nCaltrans Rest Areas (8-hr limit; not camping): Pull in late, leave early, use well-lit, busy facilities. Example on your route: Camp Roberts on US-101. (Legal Information Institute)\nSome Walmarts allow overnight by manager permission—always ask inside; varies by city. (DAT)\n\nUltra-budget paid stays:\n\nMunicipal campground: Veterans Memorial Park (Monterey) is first-come, first-served, inexpensive, and central for your 12/10 evening if you want a camp vibe. Vehicle length limits apply. (Monterey)\nHostels (HI USA) in SF/LA/SD: dorm beds and some privates; great for meeting travelers. (HI USA)\nMotels (SLO/LA/SD): December is generally cheaper on the Central Coast (SLO) with frequent sub-$120 nights. (expedia)\n\n\nYou’ll likely cover 7 nights total (nights of 12/10–12/16), with 1–2 free in Oxnard family housing and up to 2 car-sleep nights. Here are two realistic mixes:\n\nFrugal mix: 2 car-sleep nights (free), 2 family nights (free), 3 paid nights @ ~$90–$140/room ⇒ $270–$420 + tax total. (SLO/LA winter prices often fall in this band.) (expedia)\nComfort mix: 1 car-sleep night, 2 family nights, 4 paid nights @ ~$110–$160 ⇒ $440–$640 + tax.\n\n(Hostel dorms can be $30–$60/pp; privates more. Great way to trim costs in SF/LA/SD.) (HI USA)\n\n\nCheck road status same-day (winter slides/repairs on Hwy 1 can change). Caltrans site/QuickMap are the source of truth. (California Road Information)\nRest areas = “rest,” not camping. CA regs: no more than 8 hours in any 24-hour period. Move on after a night. (Legal Information Institute)\nAsk before parking overnight at private lots (Walmart, etc.); manager permission is key. (DAT)\nSan Diego wildlife (La Jolla): observe from a distance; it’s a protected marine area. (Airial)\nAirport morning: Sleep within 15–20 minutes of LAX on 12/16, and return your car with a buffer.\n\n\n\nChannel Islands outing from Oxnard (half- or full-day via Island Packers). Weather-dependent, magical. (Island Packers)\nSanta Barbara mission/shoreline walk en route.\nPacific Surfliner for a chill, scenic San Diego day without LA freeways. (Amtrak)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI thought that Chat did a good job proposing an idea. It provided me a lot of information to think about for my planning and it was helpful that it provided specific links to go follow. I particularly liked the day-by-day break down part and the safety + logistics tips part. I was unaware of the policies surrounding sleeping at rest stops and in Walmart parking lots (which seems a little sketch).\nI forgot to tell Chat that we would have our own car and would not have to rent. I wanted to get a more succinct plan so I asked it to make a detailed day-by-day itinerary:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nRoute / Stay\nDriving Time\nKey Stops & Activities\nLodging / Notes\n\n\n\n\nDec 9 (Tue)\nArrive SFO → Bay Area\n—\nLand, pick up rental, grab dinner in SF or Peninsula\nStay in SF/San Jose (Hostel or budget hotel $80–$120)\n\n\nDec 10 (Wed)\nBay Area → Monterey → San Luis Obispo/Pismo\n4–5 h\nScenic HWY-1 drive to Carmel, Point Lobos, Bixby Creek Bridge (north viewpoints only); cut to US-101 via Salinas\nSleep: Camp Roberts Rest Area (8 hr limit) or budget motel in SLO ($90–$120)\n\n\nDec 11 (Thu)\nSLO/Pismo → Santa Barbara → Oxnard\n3 h\nExplore downtown SLO, Santa Barbara Mission + beach walk; arrive in Oxnard evening\nStay with family (Oxnard – free)\n\n\nDec 12 (Fri)\nOxnard (day)\n—\nRelax with family, Channel Islands Harbor walk or Island Packers boat trip\nFamily stay (Oxnard)\n\n\nDec 13 (Sat)\nOxnard → Los Angeles\n1.5 h\nMalibu coast drive, Santa Monica Pier, evening in LA downtown or Silver Lake\nBudget motel or car-sleep (permitted area) ~$100\n\n\nDec 14 (Sun)\nLA → San Diego\n2.5–3 h\nDrive or train to SD; visit La Jolla Cove, Balboa Park, Old Town\nHostel or budget hotel in SD ($90–$130) or return to LA\n\n\nDec 15 (Mon)\nSan Diego → LA (return)\n2.5–3 h\nMorning coffee + beach walk in SD; drive back to LA midday to avoid traffic\nStay LA area (hostel/motel ~$110)\n\n\nDec 16 (Tue)\nLA → LAX area prep\n≤ 1 h\nRelax, pack, return rental car fuel topped-off\nStay near LAX (El Segundo/Inglewood motel $120 avg)\n\n\nDec 17 (Wed)\nFly out LAX by 9 a.m.\n—\nArrive airport 6:45–7 a.m. for check-in\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeed: Instead of manually digging route-blogs, lodging sites, and safe-sleep car tips, I got a structured plan in minutes.\nFlexibility: I can ask follow-ups (“What options under $80 night in Morro Bay?” “Which rest stops allow overnight car parking in Ventura county?”) and iterate.\nCustomization: I told it my specific dates, number of people, tolerance for car-sleeping and budget. The response reflected my preferences.\nPrompt-ing clarity: By stating start date, end date, group size, willingness to sleep in car + lodging preference + budget, I gave the LLM the right parameters to generate a realistic plan.\n\nI’m excited. This trip feels very doable with our timeline. There’s a mix of driving, exploring, rest, flexibility (car-sleep or motel), family time in Oxnard, and that extra special day in San Diego. Using ChatGPT to map out the plan saved me a ton of mental work and gave me a structure to build off of."

    "text": "The LLM gave me some images to start:\n\nThen outlined the trip it had planned:\n\n\n\nRoute shape: Bay Area → Monterey/Carmel (scenic stop) → US-101 via San Luis Obispo → Santa Barbara → Oxnard (family nights) → Los Angeles → San Diego day-trip → back to LA (sleep near LAX on 12/16).\nBig Sur caution: Highway 1 through Big Sur still has long-term closures; plan to enjoy the northern Big Sur viewpoints from Carmel/Monterey, then cut back to US-101 for the through-drive south. Always check Caltrans trip-day status. (SFGATE)\nCar-sleep rules: CA rest areas allow up to 8 hours; camping is prohibited. Look for posted “8 HOUR PARKING” signs (Caltrans/MUTCD). (Legal Information Institute)\nWalmart overnights: Allowed case-by-case by store manager (varies by city ordinances). Ask the specific store. (DAT)\nTrain option for San Diego: If you don’t want to fight I-5 traffic, the Amtrak Pacific Surfliner runs frequent LA↔︎SD trains (walkable stations). (Amtrak)\n\n\nDec 9 – Arrive SFO Crash wherever you’re staying in the Bay. If you want a budget SF option night-of: Hostelling International (dorms/private). (HI USA)\nDec 10 – Bay Area → Monterey/Carmel → San Luis Obispo/Pismo (sleep)\n\nMorning: Drive HWY-1 to Carmel, Point Lobos pull-offs, Bixby vista if open from the north (turn around before closures), then hop to US-101 via Salinas/Prunedale. (SFGATE)\nSleep (choose one):\n\nVery cheap car-camp (legal): CA rest area on US-101 (e.g., Camp Roberts near San Miguel) — max 8 hrs. (yelp.com)\nBudget motel in San Luis Obispo/Pismo (often $60–$120 range in December). (expedia)\n\n\nDec 11 – SLO/Pismo → Santa Barbara → Oxnard (family)\n\nRoll the coast on US-101. Afternoon in Santa Barbara; sunset in Channel Islands Harbor after you land in Oxnard. (channelislandsharbor.org)\nSleep: with family (1 of 1–2 free nights).\n\nDec 12 – Oxnard (family day)\n\nOptions: Harbor walk, kayak, or consider a Channel Islands boat if seas/coast weather look good (Island Packers runs park/ferry & wildlife trips). (Island Packers)\nSleep: with family (2 of 2 free nights, or just 1 if you prefer more LA time).\n\nDec 13 – Oxnard → Los Angeles (sleep)\n\nShort hop. Explore LA neighborhoods or beaches.\nSleep: budget motel/hostel in LA or a permitted rest area stop along a freeway outside dense neighborhoods if you want a second car-sleep night (observe posted limits). (Legal Information Institute)\n\nDec 14 – LA → San Diego (sleep in SD or return to LA) Two good ways:\n\nDrive I-5 early (2–3 hrs off-peak), or\nTrain Pacific Surfliner from LA Union Station → San Diego (walkable to transit/Balboa Park connections). (Amtrak)\n\n\nSD highlights for a single day: La Jolla Cove (sea lions/seals), Balboa Park, Old Town. (La Jolla is a protected area; keep a respectful distance from wildlife.) (Tripadvisor)\nSleep: Either inexpensive SD hostel/motel or back in LA (see budget section sources). (expedia)\n\nDec 15 – Back to LA (if you slept in SD)\n\nExtra LA sightseeing or beach day.\nSleep: LA area.\n\nDec 16 – Stage for LAX\n\nKeep this night near LAX/El Segundo so the 9am arrival on the 17th is easy. Choose a basic motel/airport hotel; car-sleep is not recommended near the airport due to city ordinances and parking enforcement.\nSleep: LAX-area lodging.\n\nDec 17 – Fly from LAX ~9am\n\nReturn the car and roll out.\n\n\nLegal, safe car-sleep options (max 2 nights total like you wanted):\n\nCaltrans Rest Areas (8-hr limit; not camping): Pull in late, leave early, use well-lit, busy facilities. Example on your route: Camp Roberts on US-101. (Legal Information Institute)\nSome Walmarts allow overnight by manager permission—always ask inside; varies by city. (DAT)\n\nUltra-budget paid stays:\n\nMunicipal campground: Veterans Memorial Park (Monterey) is first-come, first-served, inexpensive, and central for your 12/10 evening if you want a camp vibe. Vehicle length limits apply. (Monterey)\nHostels (HI USA) in SF/LA/SD: dorm beds and some privates; great for meeting travelers. (HI USA)\nMotels (SLO/LA/SD): December is generally cheaper on the Central Coast (SLO) with frequent sub-$120 nights. (expedia)\n\n\nYou’ll likely cover 7 nights total (nights of 12/10–12/16), with 1–2 free in Oxnard family housing and up to 2 car-sleep nights. Here are two realistic mixes:\n\nFrugal mix: 2 car-sleep nights (free), 2 family nights (free), 3 paid nights @ ~$90–$140/room ⇒ $270–$420 + tax total. (SLO/LA winter prices often fall in this band.) (expedia)\nComfort mix: 1 car-sleep night, 2 family nights, 4 paid nights @ ~$110–$160 ⇒ $440–$640 + tax.\n\n(Hostel dorms can be $30–$60/pp; privates more. Great way to trim costs in SF/LA/SD.) (HI USA)\n\n\nCheck road status same-day (winter slides/repairs on Hwy 1 can change). Caltrans site/QuickMap are the source of truth. (California Road Information)\nRest areas = “rest,” not camping. CA regs: no more than 8 hours in any 24-hour period. Move on after a night. (Legal Information Institute)\nAsk before parking overnight at private lots (Walmart, etc.); manager permission is key. (DAT)\nSan Diego wildlife (La Jolla): observe from a distance; it’s a protected marine area. (Airial)\nAirport morning: Sleep within 15–20 minutes of LAX on 12/16, and return your car with a buffer.\n\n\n\nChannel Islands outing from Oxnard (half- or full-day via Island Packers). Weather-dependent, magical. (Island Packers)\nSanta Barbara mission/shoreline walk en route.\nPacific Surfliner for a chill, scenic San Diego day without LA freeways. (Amtrak)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Comparing AI Detection Results on ChatGPT 5.0, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and local DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B.\nI gave the 3 models the same prompt: Explain how photosynthesis works in plants (3-5 sentences).\nI then used zeroGPT.com to analyze each of their responses. The results were as follows:\n\nChatGPT 5.0:\nPhotosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose (sugar) and oxygen. This takes place mainly in the chloroplasts of plant cells, where the green pigment chlorophyll absorbs light energy. The light energy powers chemical reactions that split water molecules, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. The glucose made provides energy and building material for the plant’s growth and survival.\nAI Detector Result:\n\nGemini 2.5 Flash:\nPhotosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy to create their own food. Plants absorb water through their roots and carbon dioxide (CO^2) through tiny pores in their leaves called stomata. Using chlorophyll to capture energy from sunlight, these raw materials are transformed into glucose (a sugar for energy) and oxygen (O^2). The oxygen is then released as a byproduct, making the process vital for life on Earth.\nAI Detector Result:\n\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B (did not keep it 3-5 sentences):\nPhotosynthesis is a process where plants convert sunlight into chemical energy to fuel their growth and survival. This occurs primarily in chloroplasts, which contain chlorophyll giving them their green color. The process consists of two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle.\nIn the light-dependent reactions (PSII), water molecules are split using ATP synthase, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This step also produces ATP and NADPH, energy carriers essential for the next stage.\nThe Calvin cycle (PC) involves fixing carbon dioxide into organic compounds through enzyme-driven reactions in the stroma of chloroplasts. Using ATP and NADPH, CO2 is converted into glucose, providing plants with the energy they need to grow and develop. This process ensures that plants can synthesize their own food using sunlight as an energy source.\nAI Detector Result:\n\n\nJust by copy and pasting the outputs from the models, the AI detector correctly identified each of the responses as 100% AI generated. However, I wanted to see what it would say about other likely non-AI generated responses. I went to Wikipedia and to National Geographic and copied the first couple lines of the article on photosynthesis. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis and https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/photosynthesis/).\nI also went to Quora and grabbed an explanation from 12 years ago (https://www.quora.com/What-is-photosynthesis-and-how-does-it-work).\n\nWikipedia:\nPhotosynthesis is a system of biological processes by which photopigment-bearing autotrophic organisms, such as most plants, algae and cyanobacteria, convert light energy — typically from sunlight — into the chemical energy necessary to fuel their metabolism. The term photosynthesis usually refers to oxygenic photosynthesis, a process that releases oxygen as a byproduct of water splitting. Photosynthetic organisms store the converted chemical energy within the bonds of intracellular organic compounds (complex compounds containing carbon), typically carbohydrates like sugars (mainly glucose, fructose and sucrose), starches, phytoglycogen and cellulose. When needing to use this stored energy, an organism's cells then metabolize the organic compounds through cellular respiration.\nAI Detector Result:\n\nNational Geographic:\nPhotosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create oxygen and energy in the form of sugar. During photosynthesis, plants take in carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) from the air and soil. Within the plant cell, the water is oxidized, meaning it loses electrons, while the carbon dioxide is reduced, meaning it gains electrons. This transforms the water into oxygen and the carbon dioxide into glucose. The plant then releases the oxygen back into the air, and stores energy within the glucose molecules.\nAI Detector Result:\n\nQuora:\nPhotosynthesis occurs in two stages. In the first stage, light-dependent reactions or light reactions capture the energy of light and use it to make the energy-storage molecules ATP (Adenosine Thiosulphate) and NADPH. During the second stage, the light-independent reactions use these products to capture and reduce carbon dioxide. Most organisms that utilize photosynthesis to produce oxygen use visible light to do so, although at least three use infrared radiation.\nAI Detector Result:\n\n\nBoth of the articles were also classified 100% as AI-generated. I am not convinced that these articles were actually written by AI, but there is potential they were. I am very confident that the Quora answer was not AI generated, given that it was posted 12 years ago, yet the detector found that it was almost 70% AI generated.\nOverall, I think this AI detector may be overconfident in its detection of AI vs. Human. In practice, this makes them unreliable for truly distinguishing between human and machine-written content."
