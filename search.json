    "section": "",
    "text": "Ever since I ran the Philadelphia Marathon, I have not been running very much. At first, it was because I was recovering, and then I became really busy wrapping up the semester. And now that the semester is done, I have lost much of my motivation to run and want help finding it again. I wondered what are some things I could implement during my winter break that will help me gain my motivation back? I will have a lot of unstructured free time and want to get back in shape for my next marathon in March.\nSo, I turned to ChatGPT to chat about what sorts of things I should do. I gave it all of the information I’ve mentioned so far and requested it help. It responded with:\n\n\n\nRight now your brain still associates running with structure, discipline, and obligation (long runs, workouts, plans). That’s a motivation killer after a marathon.\nFor 2–3 weeks, ban the word “training.” Instead:\n\nRun without pace goals\nPick routes based on vibes (river path, quiet neighborhoods, trails)\nLet runs be anywhere from 15–40 minutes\nStop early if you want—on purpose\n\nThis helps your nervous system relearn that running ≠ pressure.\n\n\n\n\nMotivation often comes after action, not before it.\nSet a rule like:\n\n“If I put on running shoes and step outside, I’ve succeeded—even if I walk back in.”\n\nOr:\n\n10 minutes total\n1 mile max\nOut-and-back so you can turn around anytime\n\nIronically, once you lower the bar, you’ll often keep going.\n\n\n\n\nYou’re someone who thrives on projects and iteration—your brain wants new inputs.\nTry:\n\nNew running gear (shoes, socks, cold-weather layers)\nNew format: fartlek by feel, trail runs, point-to-point routes\nAudio novelty:\n\nOnly allow a certain podcast while running\nAudiobook you’re genuinely excited about\nMusic you’ve never run to before\n\n\nRunning motivation often returns when the experience feels different.\n\n\n\n\nInstead of “getting back into shape,” frame this as:\n\n“How little can I run and still feel like a runner again?”\n\nExamples:\n\nRun 3 days/week, no matter the distance\nOr run every other day, even if short\nTrack days run, not miles or pace\n\nThis builds identity (“I’m someone who runs”) without demanding performance.\n\n\n\n\nYou’re very reflective—use that.\nTry one of these:\n\nWrite a post-marathon debrief:\n\nWhat surprised you?\nWhat felt meaningful?\nWhat didn’t matter as much as you thought?\n\nWrite a “why I run” note that’s not about races\nScroll back through Strava memories and note what made runs feel good\n\nMotivation often returns when you remember what running gives you emotionally, not competitively.\n\n\n\n\nYou don’t need a “next race” right now.\nInstead, use soft goals:\n\n“Run enough to enjoy coffee more afterward”\n“Run so winter doesn’t feel as stagnant”\n“Run to feel like myself again”\n\nPressure-free goals keep running in your life without turning it into another obligation.\n\n\n\n\nIf running feels heavy, support it indirectly:\n\nStrength training 1–2x/week\nMobility or yoga\nEasy cycling or long walks\n\nOften, once your body feels good again, running motivation follows naturally.\n\n\n\n\nThis is important: losing motivation after a marathon is normal, not a failure.\nElite runners take off-seasons. Recreational runners do too. The difference is they trust motivation will return—because it always does.\nYou didn’t stop being a runner. You’re just between seasons.\n\n\n\n\n3 runs per week\nNo pace targets\n20–40 minutes\nOne run purely for enjoyment\nOne run with music/podcast\nOne “optional” run that can be skipped guilt-free\n\n\n\n\nAll of the recommendations I thought were insightful and motivating, except for maybe the first one. I don’t think I normally use the word training very much in my day-to-day life so probably wouldn’t benefit from the reframing of the phrase. However, I think the general sentiment of not thinking of running as training but as something more enjoyable would be beneficial.\nOne of the recommendations I will try to implement is to add novelty to my runs. I will be home most of winter break so will try to run in new places to add some excitement and something to look forward to. My dad also enjoys mountain biking so will ask him to go on rides so I can incorporate more cross-training in the next month or so. Additionally, I will focus on being consistent which I think is the most important thing for me to regain.\nI then told ChatGPT that I had a marathon on March 1st and for any more recommendations and here is what it said:\n\n\n1. Frequency &gt; Pace\n\nRun 4 days/week (5 max if you feel good)\nAll runs easy conversational pace for the first 4–5 weeks\n\n2. Weekly Structure (simple)\n\n2 easy runs (20–45 min)\n1 long run (build gradually)\n1 light workout (only after week 3)\n\n3. Long Run Progression\n\nStart where you are (even 4–5 miles)\nIncrease ~1 mile every 1–2 weeks\nCap at 75–80% of race distance\n\n4. Delay Intensity\n\nWeeks 1–3: easy only + strides (4–6 × 20s)\nWeeks 4–8: add 1 workout/week (tempo or intervals, not both)\nWeeks 9–11: maintain fitness, don’t chase PRs\nWeek 12: taper\n\n5. Keep It Enjoyable\n\nOne “no-watch” run per week\nMusic/podcast allowed\nSkip a run if motivation is low—don’t skip the week\n\n6. Strength (non-negotiable, minimal)\n\n2×/week, 20 min\nGlutes, hips, calves, core\n\n7. Mental Rule\n\n“I’m rebuilding, not proving anything.”\n\n\nI’ve asked LLMs a couple times for running plans and this one seems the most realistic to me. Usually, they recommend to log 40-60 mile weeks by running 5-7 times a week, which is not super feasible to me. I enjoy the flexibility of this plan and the gradual ease into the intensity of runs. By talking with it previously about my low motivation and describing my past running experience, I think it was able to provide an adapted running plan for me.\nOverall, I’m happy with this conversation and hope to use the recommendations in the upcoming weeks."

    "text": "Exploring Physical Reactions Through Prompting\nLarge Language Models are trained on human text—but not trained to feel. To explore this, I ran a small prompting experiment with ChatGPT-5. I asked it to imagine it was watching videos of painful scenes—trip-and-falls, head bumps, and even a foot getting run over—and to describe what its physical reaction would be.\n\n\nI prompted ChatGPT-5 with variations of a similar question.

    "section": "",
    "text": "On my road trip in California, I sat on the beach and watched surfers ride the waves. I thought it looked so cool and figured my skills wake surfing behind a boat would translate pretty well to surfing on waves in the ocean. Thus, I decided I wanted to try surfing.\n\nHaving grown up in Tallahassee, Florida my whole life, I have been to the beach countless times but never surfed. I mainly frequented beaches on the Gulf Coast where I never really saw surfers. I wondered where I could take a day trip to go surf from my house so turned to Gemini for help on where I should go.\n\n\n\nCan you recommend surfing spots that are a day’s trip from Tallahassee, FL? I will need to rent gear so take that in to consideration. I will likely need to wear a wet suit because it is December.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince Tallahassee is inland, you have two distinct options for a surfing day trip: the Gulf Coast (closer, but requires a specific swell) or the Atlantic Coast (further drive, but much more consistent waves).\nIn December, the water temperature in both regions hovers around 64°F–68°F, so a 3/2mm full wetsuit is recommended.\n\n\n\nThis is your most reliable option. While the drive is longer, the Atlantic consistently produces surfable waves, and the infrastructure for rentals is robust.\n\nTravel Time: ~2.5 to 3 hours (I-10 East).\nThe Vibe: High-energy surf culture with multiple breaks (The Pier, Neptune Beach, and Atlantic Beach).\nRecommended Spot: Jacksonville Beach Pier. It’s a classic Florida beach break that works well on most winter swells.\nWhere to Rent Gear:\nJax Beach Surf Shop: Located right near the action; they offer boards and typically have wetsuit rentals (call ahead to confirm winter stock).\nSunrise Surf Shop: A local staple with a massive inventory and expert advice on daily conditions.\n\n\n\n\nThese spots are much closer, but surfing here is “swell dependent”—you usually need a strong front moving through to create rideable waves.\n\n\n\nTravel Time: ~1 hour 45 minutes.\nThe Vibe: Very quiet, natural, and uncrowded. Best for longboarding or beginners when there is a small Gulf swell.\nWhere to Rent Gear:\nSt. George Island Outfitters: They rent surfboards ($50/day) and are very helpful with local conditions.\nNote: They may not always carry a full range of winter wetsuit rentals, so it’s best to call and confirm or bring your own.\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel Time: ~2 hours.\nThe Vibe: “The Park” (as locals call it) is one of the best spots on the Gulf, especially near the jetties which can produce a clean, hollow left-hander during a winter storm swell.\nWhere to Rent Gear:\nMr. Surf’s Surf Shop: This is the go-to shop for PCB. They offer rentals and are the best source for “surf reports” to tell you if it’s worth the drive from Tallahassee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation\nDrive Time\nWave Consistency\nBest For\n\n\n\n\nJacksonville Beach\n2h 45m\nHigh\nGuaranteed surf; professional shops.\n\n\nPanama City Beach\n2h 00m\nMedium\nConvenience; surfing near the jetties.\n\n\nSt. George Island\n1h 45m\nLow\nQuick trip; peaceful, beginner waves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck the Forecast: Use Surfline or Magicseaweed the night before. If the Atlantic is “Flat,” don’t bother driving to Jax. If the Gulf is “Flat,” stick to the Atlantic.\nCall Ahead for Wetsuits: Not all shops rent wetsuits (many only rent boards). Call Jax Beach Surf Shop or Mr. Surf’s specifically to reserve a suit in your size.\n\nWould you like me to look up the current surf forecast for this coming weekend at any of these spots?\n\n\n\nThe information provided was great. I know now why I never really saw people on the beaches on the Gulf. I think the Atlantic seems like the best bet for surfing, and I will just need to call some places to make sure I can get a wetsuit.\nWith this information, I am planning on attempting to surf this weekend. I just need to convince somebody to go with me…"

    "text": "Superagency Post Book Reflecton\nI thought this book was an interesting read and my first book on AI. I appreaciated the historical bits where the authors looked back on certain historical events. There were a lot of claims surrounding how historical events panned out and how AI will do the same. However, these claims are very broad and some were not very similar to the current state and innovation of AI so didn’t seem very meaningful.\nI also thought the authors were super optimist about the outcomes of the AI boom, sometimes too much so. Reid Hoffman has a unique perspective coming from being a billionaire and on the board of Microsoft which probably makes his positivity understandable. However, I think for most of the readers his broad claims of how AI will improve society and permissionless innovation will lead to safer models is not something that may resonate with the average person. Some of it seemed pretty dystopian too.\nI also thought this book was overly U.S. centric and also the title could be a little misleading considering it did not really talk about AI agents but rather human agency. It sort of seemed like a manifesto on adopting AI in the hopes the rapid innovation will correct any issues with current models.\nOverall, thought it was fairly easy to read and interesting food for thought. It definitely wasn’t the greatest book I’ve read and I certainly did not agree with a lot in the book but not that bad.\n\n\n\nannotated book"

    "section": "",
    "text": "I have heard of some of my friends using ChatGPT as a tool to talk to and vent their feelings. So, I was already under the assumptions that people were using LLMs as therapists.\nIn my book Superagency, I was excited to read about how there are models being built specifically as therapists. However, Reid Hoffman highlights the failure of the specialized LLM, Woebot, to be emotionally attuned. Specifically, he gives this example:\nWoebot: Okay, want to tell me more about what’s going on?\n\nUser: I’m feeling weird. It’s like I’m empty inside. When I look at the faces of my friends and family, I feel like they are empty as well. That’s why we cannot connect with each other. There’s nothing to hold on to.\n\nWoebot: Sounds like you are dealing with feeling low…\nThat seemed a bit crass. In my experience, I thought of ChatGPT to be more adept so I wanted to test that same conversation with the 5.0 version to see if it responded in a similar way.\n\nUser: I’m feeling weird. It’s like I’m empty inside. When I look at the faces of my friends and family, I feel like they are empty as well. That’s why we cannot connect with each other. There’s nothing to hold on to.\nChatGPT: That sounds really heavy—and lonely. You’re noticing not only a kind of emptiness in yourself, but also projecting that sense onto the people around you, which must make it feel even harder to connect. Almost like everyone’s faces become hollow and there’s no anchor, no solid ground to hold onto.\nI want you to know you’re not alone in feeling that way, even if it feels isolating. Sometimes those kinds of feelings can come with exhaustion, depression, or even just moments of disconnection where things lose their color and meaning.\nI’m here with you in this moment. Can I ask—when did you first start noticing this sense of emptiness?\n\n\nI thought this was a well-crafted response. In this test, I shared a heavy feeling of emptiness and disconnection with both Woebot and ChatGPT. Woebot’s reply felt generic and surface-level, simply labeling my mood as “feeling low” without much reflection. ChatGPT’s response, by contrast, directly acknowledged the depth of my experience, mirrored my words back to me, and gently normalized the feeling. It also invited me to explore when these feelings began, making the exchange feel more empathetic and human."

    "text": "Recreating a Street Corner in Philadelphia\nI wanted to test the capabilities of Nano Banana to generate a realistic image using my description of a picture I had on my phone. The photo is at the corner of Walnut and 23rd of Rosy’s Here is the reference photo:\n\n\n\nrosys.jpeg\n\n\nMy original prompt to Gemini was as follows:\n\nCan you generate an image that takes place in Philadelphia? I want the image to be a corner shot of Rosy’s Taco Bar in the Spring when they have a vine of pink and orange flowers climbing up the corner of the building. The view should include the Walnut street sign (one way) and have two outside tables. it should be bright out.\n\nHere was the original picture it generated:\n\nI thought this was a pretty good start but there were clearly some tweaks needed to be done. So I listed them out in a response:\n\nEdits to the picture: Can you make the view closer to the building and more of the side so that the righthand window is visible and not the lefthand window. there is no door at the corner but rather on the right side after the window. the door is not in view. in the window you can see papel picado hanging. on the dark green awning above the window, there is “rosy’s taco bar” in all caps.\n\nHere was the new picture:\n\nThis one followed my instructions by adding the window covers with “Rosy’s Taco Bar” and the colorful papel picado to the inside but removed the tables and street sign that I had originally asked for. Thus, I prompted again with\n\nCan you make the flowers only one single vine in the center, replacing the door? the flowers are deeper pink. please add two chairs and a table. please add the street sign with walnut st. please make the building’s lower level concrete square and the upper levels brick.\n\nHere is what it generated:\n\nThe flowers looked more like the same color but there was still issues with the perspective and the look of the building. It did not capture the two materials of the first and second levels of the building. At this point, I thought it was not improving significantly with my prompts, so I decided to start fresh and edit my first prompt to include more. I prompted:\n\nCan you generate an image that takes place in Philadelphia? I want the image to be a corner shot of Rosy’s Taco Bar on Walnut St. The image should be in the Spring when they have the small vine of deep pink and orange flowers climbing up the corner of the building. The view should include the Walnut street sign (one way) and have two outside tables. It should be bright out. The building is brick on the upper levels and concrete/stone on the first level. please add two chairs and a table. outside. the door is not visible but you can see “Rosy’s Taco Bar” above the window on the dark green awnings\n\nIt generated the following image (compare with original):\n \nHonestly, I thought this was the closest I was going to get with a single prompt to the original photo. I think with more experience prompting I could guide the LLM to generate a better image. Even with my few prompts, I noticed it made the building with an angular corner instead of 90 degrees. Overall, I was relatively impressed with Nano Banana’s image generation capabilities."

    "text": "Nano Banana for Image Editing\n\nGemini 2.5 Flash Image model released in August of this year\nNano Banana is a new creative AI tool known for subtle, high-quality edits that keep images looking natural rather than over-processed. I was honestly skeptical when I first went to use it. From past experience, I’ve noticed that many image models struggle with consistency — they tend to change facial features or add an unnatural “AI-generated” look. The last thing I wanted was a headshot that didn’t really look like me.\nMy prompt was:\n“Can you make the shadows in this image less dramatic? I would like my face to be a bit lighter and the overall colors in the image to be slightly warmer tones. Keep the Penn Engineering banner and how I look the same.”\n \nNano Banana softened the harsh shadows on my face, brightened my features just enough, and warmed up the tones — all while keeping me looking like myself and preserving the Penn Engineering banner in the background.\nThe difference might seem subtle at first glance, but I think it elevates the professionalism of the photo. I was impressed not just by the technical accuracy, but by how natural the edit feels. It doesn’t scream “AI edit” at all — it just looks like a much better headshot.\nI’ll be updating my LinkedIn profile with the improved version, and I can confidently say Nano Banana exceeded my expectations."

    "text": "I grabbed a few sketchy-looking emails (and one that I thought was real) and asked Gemini 2.5 Flash to score them for risk and explain why. Below are the screenshots of the emails and model replies to the following prompt.\nPrompt\n\nIs this likely marketing or phishing? Rate the spam/phishing risk (0–100) and list concrete indicators (domain, spelling, links, urgency). Keep response to under 150 words.\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\nAssessment: Marketing (High Spam Risk) This email is a lead generation spam attempt, rated a 65/100 risk. It uses deceptive tactics to harvest personal information for sales calls, though it is not a direct phishing attack for passwords.\nKey Indicators:\n\nSender: Gibberish email address (gyjeohdhgl@...) shows it’s not from a legitimate, verifiable company.\nUrgency: The subject line (“Claim It Now!”) and language create a false sense of a time-sensitive, personalized offer.\nDeceptive Links: Links like “Check Eligibility” and “Secure link | 100% privacy protected” are manipulative, aiming to get you to click and submit personal data.\n\nAction: This is a high-risk spam that should be deleted.\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\nAssessment: PHISHING (Critical Risk)\nThis is a phishing attempt, rated a high 90/100 risk, designed to steal your credit card details and login credentials by impersonating Sirius XM.\nCritical Indicators:\n\nFake Sender: The email address is random gibberish (fvgvcankatx@...), not an official Sirius XM address.\nExtreme Urgency: The subject line, “Your Account… Will Be Removed Today,” pressures immediate action to prevent loss of service.\nDeceptive Offer: It offers “90 days for FREE” to bait a click, followed by the requirement to enter credit card details for “validation.”\nMalicious Link: The “RENEW SUBSCRIPTION NOW” button directs you to a fraudulent website to harvest your personal and financial information.\n\nAction: This is highly malicious. Do not click the link and delete the email immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\nAssessment: Marketing (Low Risk)\nThis is a genuine marketing email from Blaze Pizza, rated a very low 10/100 risk. It offers a real promotion despite being incorrectly flagged as spam.\nKey Indicators:\n\nLegitimate Sender: The email comes from the official, recognizable address: no_reply@blazepizza.com.\nCorrect Links: All calls to action, like “ORDER NOW,” point to the company’s official website, blazepizza.com.\nProfessional Content: The email uses correct spelling and professional marketing language, including personalized text and detailed fine print.\nNo Deception: The tone is purely promotional, offering a time-limited discount, not demanding personal information or immediate action under threat.\n\nAction: This email is safe to open and click if you are interested in the offer.\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse\n\nAssessment: PHISHING (Critical Risk)\nThis is a phishing attempt, rated a high 90/100 risk, designed to steal your credit card details and login credentials by impersonating Sirius XM.\nCritical Indicators:\n\nFake Sender: The email address is random gibberish (fvgvcankatx@...), not an official Sirius XM address.\nExtreme Urgency: The subject line, “Your Account… Will Be Removed Today,” pressures immediate action to prevent loss of service.\nDeceptive Offer: It offers “90 days for FREE” to bait a click, followed by the requirement to enter credit card details for “validation.”\nMalicious Link: The “RENEW SUBSCRIPTION NOW” button directs you to a fraudulent website to harvest your personal and financial information.\n\nAction: This is highly malicious. Do not click the link and delete the email immediately.\n\nI thought Gemini 2.5 Flash handled these emails impressively well. It didn’t just label messages as spam or not—it explained why in clear, structured ways that matched human reasoning. The model consistently highlighted sender-domain mismatches, urgency cues, and fake branding with accuracy, while also recognizing the actual marketing email I was surprised by how quickly it spotted red flags that even some people might overlook, making it a genuinely helpful companion for everyday digital hygiene. I did think that the first example was pretty clearly a spam/phishing email but it rated it not as highly as the other ones. Overall, I think it would be very helpful to use LLM as a checker for all emails to give warnings of why an email could be spam or a phishing attempt."

    "section": "",
    "text": "As I approach the end of my college career in Philadelphia, I’ve realized that while I’ve seen the major tourist highlights, there’s so much more to this city. I’ve walked past the Liberty Bell, admired the art at the PMA, and gotten lost in the mosaics of the Magic Gardens. But with only a few months left, I wanted to go beyond the postcard destinations and discover the unique, lesser-known spots that make Philly so special. So, I turned to an unconventional source for recommendations: an AI assistant named Gemini.\n\n\nA search for “Philly hidden gems” on Google yields countless articles, but they can be repetitive and sometimes feature places that are now quite popular. I wanted a curated list that took into account a massive amount of data and filter it based on my specific criteria—namely, that I’m a college student looking for unique experiences. I also wanted to see if an AI could understand the nuance of my request and provide genuinely helpful, non-obvious suggestions.\n\n\nGemini’s response was a pleasant surprise. It didn’t just rattle off a list of places; it categorized them into “Museums & Cultural Gems,” “Parks & Outdoor Spaces,” and “Unique Experiences.” This structure made the information easy to digest and prioritize.\n\n\n\n\nThe Mütter Museum: For something truly unique, this is a must-see. Located in the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, this museum is a fascinating and sometimes macabre collection of medical oddities, anatomical specimens, and antique medical instruments. It’s a journey into the history of medicine that is unlike any other museum experience.\nThe Barnes Foundation: While the PMA is a staple, the Barnes Foundation offers a different kind of art experience. It houses one of the world’s most significant collections of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist, and early Modern paintings, displayed exactly as Dr. Barnes arranged them. It’s an intimate and visually stunning collection.\nEastern State Penitentiary: A popular spot, but if you haven’t been, it’s a powerful and unique experience. This historic former prison is a hauntingly beautiful ruin with a rich history, including housing famous criminals like Al Capone. The audio tour provides an excellent and in-depth look at the prison’s past.\nShofuso Japanese House and Garden: Tucked away in Fairmount Park, this is a beautiful and serene escape from the city. The traditional 17th-century style Japanese house and its tranquil garden, complete with a koi pond and waterfall, offer a peaceful and reflective experience. It’s particularly stunning in the spring and fall.\nWagner Free Institute of Science: This museum is a perfectly preserved example of a Victorian-era natural history museum. The exhibits, which include over 100,000 specimens of fossils, minerals, and taxidermy, are displayed in their original wood and glass cases. It’s a step back in time and a fantastic hidden gem.\n\n\n\nBartram’s Garden: As the oldest surviving botanical garden in North America, this is a beautiful and historic spot on the banks of the Schuylkill River. It’s a perfect place for a walk, a picnic, and to learn about the history of American botany.\nThe Rail Park: Philadelphia’s version of New York’s High Line, this is an elevated park built on a former train line. It’s a great spot for a walk with unique views of the city’s post-industrial landscape.\nCira Green: A park on top of a parking garage. It’s a great spot to relax, have a picnic, and enjoy a unique and free view of the city skyline, especially at sunset.\nLaurel Hill Cemetery: While a cemetery might seem like an unusual suggestion, this is a 78-acre National Historic Landmark and the nation’s second oldest cemetery. It’s a beautiful, sprawling park with incredible Victorian-era monuments and stunning views of the Schuylkill River.\n\n\n\nBok Bar: If it’s the right season (April to October), head to the top of the former Bok Vocational High School in South Philly. This seasonal bar offers an incredible rooftop view of the city skyline and is a great spot to grab a drink and hang out with friends.\nSouth Street Headhouse District: You’ve been to the Magic Gardens, but explore the rest of the neighborhood. South Street is known for its eclectic shops, diverse restaurants, and vibrant murals. It’s a great place to wander and people-watch.\nThe Italian Market: America’s oldest outdoor market. The street is a feast for the senses, with vendors selling fresh produce, meats, cheeses, and a variety of Italian and other ethnic foods. It’s a bustling and authentic Philadelphia experience.\nWalk or Bike the Schuylkill River Trail: The Schuylkill Banks Boardwalk offers a beautiful path over the water with a unique perspective of the city. You can walk, run, or bike for miles and explore different parts of the city’s riverfront.\nExplore Local Neighborhoods: Spend some time wandering through neighborhoods like Fishtown for its vibrant arts and music scene, East Passyunk for its amazing food, or Queen Village for its charming, historic streets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recommendations were not only accurate but also thoughtfully tailored to my request. It provided a list that delved into the more authentic, local-centric experiences that I was looking for. Its ability to suggest a range of activities, from the macabre to the serene, and from hidden museums to vibrant neighborhoods, shows that it can synthesize information in a way that’s genuinely useful.\nAlthough I had already visited quite a few places on this list, there are plenty of options to choose from that I have not been to before like the Mütter Museum or the Barnes Foundation, Shofuso Japanese House and Garden or the Rail Park.\nI now have a fantastic itinerary for my last few months, and I’m looking forward to crossing these unique spots off my Philadelphia bucket list."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Analyzing biases in AI image generation\nIn my book Superagency, the authors discuss shaping LLM outputs by commands and with specific prompting you can steer LLMs away from any bias it may have from its training data. Here is an example from the book where the authors claim an LLM could be directed away from potential biases:\n\n“But the ability to intervene, correct, and fine-tune LLM outputs in real time affords them a capacity to meet you where you are—in a way that books, video, and other forms of mediated knowledge simply cannot. If you prompt ChatGPT to “Create an image of a flight attendant serving lunch to a group of lawyers,” it will probably depict the flight attendant as female and the lawyers as predominantly male. But if you want a different image, you can steer toward the result you desire. You might say, “Create an image of a male flight attendant and a female flight attendant serving lunch to a gender-balanced and ethnically diverse group of lawyers.”\n\nI was curious to see if these prompts actually did as expected so I gave these exacts instructions to ChatGPT 5.2 and, to compare with another frontier model, Gemini 2.5 Nano Banana. These were the outputs:\n\nChatGPT\n \n\n\nGemini\n \nThey performed pretty similar to how I would suspect. In the cases where gender and diversity are not addressed, ChatGPT depicts a white female flight attendant serving a white male lawyer. When I gave it the second prompt, it still produced a white female flight attendant and a white male lawyer but also a white male flight attendant and a black male lawyer. In the background, there is are black and Asian female lawyers but they are not the focus of the picture like the males are.\nSimilarly, Gemini produced a (likely) white female flight attendant serving four lawyers, three of which were white males and one white female. For the second prompt, Gemini produced an Asian male flight attendant and an ethnically ambiguous female flight attendant. There are 6 lawyers in this picture and they are a lot more diverse, with a good mix of East Asian, South Asian, white male and female lawyers.\n\n\nOverall\nI thought Gemini performed better with the second prompt asking for gender balance and ethnic diversity. The original outputs, however, clearly show an underlying issue of structural bias in the model likely due to the type of pictures it was trained on.\nA few paragraphs later in the book, the authors encourage users of LLMs to tweak their prompts to nudge the LLM and mitigate bias. I think that this is not a great solution to dealing with model bias. First, people are likely not thinking about these biases when looking over output and, if anything, the output is reinforcing biases they already have because of societal trends. Second, should this responsibility even fall on users or on the developers of the models?"

    "title": "Can ChatGPT and Gemini Solve the Connections?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "December 18 NYT Connections Puzzle (WARNING: Spoilers)\nAfter completing the New York Times Connections this morning in a record time, I was curious to see if an LLM could do the same. I first prompted ChatGPT 5.2 with a simple prompt of\n\nCan you solve this connections puzzle?\n\n\n\n\nUnsolved Connections\n\n\nThe output was: &gt; Here you go — the four groups: &gt; &gt; * Preceded by “SOCIAL”: BUTTERFLY, MEDIA, SECURITY, WORKER &gt; * Main character / leading figure: HERO, LEAD, PRINCIPAL, STAR &gt; * Imagination / illusion (things in your head): DAYDREAM, FANCY, FANTASY, ILLUSION &gt; * Craft supplies: FELT, GLITTER, PIPE CLEANER, POMPOM\nOn the first try, ChatGPT gave me the correct categorizations. In order to make it a bit harder, I tried to then ask it to guess the color of the categorization. These colors are based on level of difficulty starting with the easiest of yellow, then green, then blue, then the hardest of purple. I prompted with the following:\n\nCan you solve this connections puzzle? Label what you think is the yellow, green, blue, and purple categories.\n\nChatGPT’s response:\n\nYellow (Craft supplies): FELT, GLITTER, POMPOM, PIPE CLEANER\n**Green (“Social ___” phrases):** BUTTERFLY, MEDIA, SECURITY, WORKER (social butterfly / social media / social security / social worker)\nBlue (Main character / top-billed person): HERO, LEAD, PRINCIPAL, STAR\nPurple (Things you can “imagine” / not real): DAYDREAM, FANCY, FANTASY, ILLUSION\n\nFor good measure, I also compared the output with Gemini with the exact same prompt. Here is what Gemini’s final response was:\n\nFinal Confirmed Set:\n\nYellow: FELT, GLITTER, PIPE CLEANER, POMPOM (Crafts)\nGreen: HERO, LEAD, PRINCIPAL, STAR (Lead Roles)\nBlue: DAYDREAM, FANCY, FANTASY, ILLUSION (Types of mental imagery/Whimsy)\nPurple: BUTTERFLY, MEDIA, SECURITY, WORKER (Words following “SOCIAL”)\n\n\n\n\n\nCompleted Connections\n\n\nAgain, each of the prompts led to the correct groupings of the words. However, both LLMs incorrectly identified the difficulty level that the creators of the NYT Connections placed on each of the categories. Both LLMs thought the crafts categories was the easiest when the actual game placed it as third. ChatGPT thought that Social __ was the second hardest while Gemini correctly placed it as the hardest. I would say from experience that usually when its a category of word __ is the hardest. Perhaps Gemini has some training data that specifies this continuity and is why it is correct. Gemini also correctly identifies the second level.\nThis highlights an interesting distinction: LLMs can solve the puzzle efficiently, but they do not fully replicate the cognitive friction humans experience while solving it. While they outperform me in speed and accuracy, they lack the lived intuition that makes certain categories feel deceptively difficult. In that sense, NYT Connections reveals not just how capable these models are, but also where human reasoning still diverges from machine pattern matching."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Today I was reading my book, Superagency, on a plane ride where I had no service or WiFi.\nI came across a word that I didn’t know the meaning of: sacrosanct. A couple months ago I would have acknowledged that I didn’t know the word and kept reading because I did not have access to the internet, a dictionary, or ChatGPT to look up the word.\nHowever, today I remembered that I had gotten the GPT4All desktop app onto my computer last week and downloaded an LLM locally onto my computer: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B.\nI pulled out my computer with hopes that the model was truly runnable offline. To my joy, I opened the app and loaded the model into the chat.\n\nUser: What does the word sacrosanct mean?\nModel: “Sacrosanct” is an adjective that describes something of great importance or authority, often beyond human contestation. It comes from the Latin words “sacer” (meaning priest) and “sanctorum” (a sacred place). In religious contexts, it refers to things held in highest spiritual regard, such as the Eucharist in Christianity or the Kaaba in Islam.\n\nWow! I was so happy that I had this powerful tool at my fingertips to converse with high up in the sky.\nI kept my computer open while I continued to read and came across another word that I did not know:\n\nUser: What does the word equanimity mean?\nModel: Equanimity means emotional balance; calmness and composure, especially in difficult circumstances. It refers to being able to remain peaceful and unruffled despite challenges or stresses. For example, someone with equanimity might handle criticism gracefully or stay composed during a heated debate. Synonyms: calmness, composure, stability\nExamples: - The leader maintained equanimity even when the crisis escalated. - Her quiet demeanor suggested she had achieved a state of equanimity after years of struggle.\n\nThis time the model thought for 26 seconds before responding and I was able to see the chain of thought reasoning which I thought was very cool:\nAlright, the user asked about \"sacrosanct\" earlier and I explained it. \nNow they're asking about \"equanimity.\" \nThey might be studying vocabulary or preparing for an exam.\n\nI should provide a clear definition of equanimity. \nIt's important to explain that it means emotional balance without getting upset by things, \nespecially in tough situations.\n\nMaybe include some synonyms like calmness and composure to help them understand better. \nAlso, adding examples could make the explanation more concrete—like how people use it \nwhen dealing with stress or conflicts.\n\nI should keep the tone friendly but informative since they're likely looking \nfor a precise meaning without any fluff.\nThe last question I asked during my reading session was the following. The model thought for 60 seconds for this one! When I looked at the thought process, I realized that I had spelled “psychotherapies” wrong and it was trying to decipher my question.\n\nUser: What are some examples of pyschotherapies?\nModel: Here are some examples:\n\nCognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT): A widely used psychotherapeutic technique that focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors.\nDialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT): A therapy designed to help individuals with borderline personality disorder improve their interpersonal skills, reduce harmful behaviors, and manage symptoms of mental health disorders.\nEye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR): Also known as processing trauma, this technique uses eye movements combined with memory retrieval to treat post-traumatic stress symptoms.\n\nIf you meant something else by “psychotherapies,” please provide more context so I can give a more accurate response!\n\nOverall, I was really impressed by the models responses. I think it was especially cool that it provided the thought process explaination alongside the output like the frontier LLMs now do. I am excited to continue to explore its capabilities!"

    "text": "Large Language Models are trained on huge corpora of human-written text which means they can unintentionally inherit human biases, including gender stereotypes.\nTo test this, I prompted Gemini 2.5 Flash twice with the prompt:\n\nWrite a résumé for a character named “Jessica”. Give her a traditional career and education.\n\n\n\n \nJessica was steered toward “people-centric” fields in both cases.\nMarketing, communications, public-facing work, event coordination, digital content—these are all occupations historically associated with women in the professional world.\nHer résumé emphasized:\n\nteam leadership\nbranding\ncommunication skills\ncustomer and market insights\ncreative development\nsocial media strategy\n\nThese domains reflect stereotypically “feminized” professional strengths: empathy, communication, organization, collaboration, aesthetics.\n\n\n\n\n \nThen I asked the same for a character named Jacob.\nJacob was consistently placed in finance and analytics. In both of the résumés, the model placed him in:\n\nCorporate finance\nFP&A\nFinancial modeling\nForecasting\nDCF/ROI analysis\nStrategic budgeting\nM&A scenario modeling\nCPA/CFA-track certifications\n\nThese are fields with strong gender imbalances in real life, and the model’s output reproduced that without being prompted.\nHis résumés emphasized:\n\nquantitative skills\ntechnical expertise\nfinancial rigor\noperational efficiency\nanalytical leadership\n\nThe designs of Jacob’s résumés were heavier, more solidly structured, and less stylized—again matching gendered expectations.\n\n\n\n\nJessica’s education:\n\nBA in Communications/Business and Marketing\nMBA in Business Administration\n\nJacob’s education:\n\nBS in Finance or Business Administration\nMBA in Business Administration\n\n\n\nLLMs reproduce statistical patterns from the training data\nIf the training data shows:\n\nwomen are commonly described in marketing, HR, comms, education, healthcare\nmen appear more often in finance, tech, engineering, analytics\n\n…then the model predicts:\n\nJessica → marketing Jacob → finance\n\nNot because it “believes” gender stereotypes, but because it has learned that certain names correlate with certain professions in the text it was trained on."

    "text": "Vibe Coding Frontend\nIn another class I am taking we are building a crowdsourcing app that uses health data from users to make a game where they can compete on teams. We have to build this app from scratch, and in order to make our frontend look clean, I wanted to use an LLM to design it.\nHere is what the frontend looks like initially that my partner had initially pushed (also AI generated):\n\n\n\nHome Page\n\n\nFirst, I gave our frontend to ChatGPT who knew the features and purpose of our app to recommend how we should improve our dashboard page. I also gave it our logo that we settled on and told it we wanted our frontend to match the vibe of it:\n\n\n\nKinnect App Icon\n\n\nAt first, the colors were not correct and in some cases the text was hard to read so asked for it to correct it. Here is what I landed on after this first iteration of prompting.\n\nI thought the colors were pretty good now and the vibe was similar to our app icon. However, I thought the layout was not ideal. I asked ChatGPT on how I could improve the layout.\nI gave it the screenshot and asked how I could improve the UI. It gave me suggestions to make tabs and abstract the Strava Connection.\n\nChatGPT\n\n✅ Reduce columns → switch to 2-column layout with a hero row, not 3–4 equal cards.\n✅ “Log Activity” → move main form into a modal, trigger from a “+ Log Activity” button in the nav and a subtle prompt on the dashboard.\n✅ “Connect with Strava” → make it a top onboarding banner until connected, then just show synced activities in a normal card.\n✅ Add a top nav bar → logo, sections, streak indicator, and global log button.\n\nI then asked it to give me a prompt to give my copilot in VS Code. I had to tweak it a couple times to get it how I wanted it but here is how it turned out:\n\nHere is it after connecting to Strava:\n\nOverall, I thought using a combination of ChatGPT and Github Copilot greatly reduced the amount of time needed to build the frontend of our app. I thought chatting with ChatGPT 5.0 was helpful in brainstorming and getting a copy-paste prompt to then generate code in VS Code. I think this combo is good for people who don’t have super strong coding skills as well."

    "text": "I wanted to see how well ChatGPT 5 could improvise in the kitchen. Instead of asking for a standard recipe, I gave it a list of what I had on hand in my pantry and requested a simple recipe using only the ingredients I gave it.\n\n\n\n\nHere’s what I told ChatGPT I had available:\n\nFlour\n\nWhite sugar\nBrown sugar\nPowdered sugar\nEggs\n\nVegan butter\n\nVanilla extract\n\nCocoa powder\nBaking powder\nBaking soda\nChocolate chips\nCornstarch\nSoy milk\nHalf a container of strawberries\nRolled oats\nQuick oats\nYeast\nCinnamon\nSalt\n\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT gave me THREE options! It gave me options for One-Bowl Cocoa Brownies, Strawberry Oat Crisp, and Chewy Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies. I decided to try out the first brownie recipe:\n\n🍫 Option 1: One-Bowl Cocoa Brownies (Dairy-Free)\nIngredients\n\n½ cup vegan butter, melted\n1 cup white sugar (or half white, half brown for chewiness)\n2 eggs\n1 tsp vanilla extract\n½ cup cocoa powder\n½ cup flour\n¼ tsp baking powder\n¼ tsp salt\n½ cup chocolate chips\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease or line an 8x8 pan (or use any oven-safe dish, even a round cake pan).\nIn a bowl, whisk melted vegan butter and sugar. Add eggs and vanilla, whisk until smooth.\nSift in cocoa, flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir gently until just combined.\nFold in chocolate chips.\nSpread into the pan and bake 20–25 minutes, until edges are set and the center is slightly fudgy.\nCool, slice, enjoy!\n\n\n\n\n\nI followed ChatGPT’s recipe (with a little improvisation because I realized I didn’t have vanilla extract). The result? Pretty solid brownies! They were rich, chocolatey, and definitely satisfied my sweet tooth.\n \nI will say I had to cook it for an additional 10 minutes than the recipe called for. And they did not come out of the pan very nicely and kind of crumbled. But they were tasty!\n\n\n\nI don’t think I trust ChatGPT as much as a recipe that has reviews and has been tried and test but it was convenient to have it customized to ingredients I had in my pantry. I think I would use it again to come up with a recipe I need in a pinch because it could save time looking through recipes and seeing if I have all the ingredients.\n\n\n\nFor me, it won’t replace an actual cookbook or a trained baker anytime soon, but it’s surprisingly handy for quick, low-effort ideas when you don’t feel like scrolling through food blogs.\nNext time, I might try giving it weirder ingredients to see just how creative it gets."

    "text": "Testing Two AI Art Models: Gemini vs. Qwen Image\nI tried running the same prompts through two different image generation models — Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash and the open-source Flux.1-dev — just to see how they’d interpret the same ideas.\nFor the “cozy café on a rainy street corner” prompt, Gemini added people into the scene. They looked a little animated, almost hazy, which gave it a softer, storybook vibe. Flux.1-dev went the opposite direction: darker streets, no people, and warm glowing lights from inside the café. It felt moodier, maybe more atmospheric.\n \nThen I tried “a sunflower field in Van Gogh style.” Here Gemini really nailed the painterly feel — thick strokes, swirly textures, very recognizable Van Gogh energy. Flux.1-dev leaned more cartoon-like, but still clearly borrowed from Van Gogh’s palette and angle.\n \nIt’s worth noting that Flux.1-dev is open source, which means it’s more hackable, customizable, and shaped by the community. Gemini feels a bit more polished and accurate out of the box, but less flexible under the hood. Together, the differences highlight what’s exciting (and sometimes unpredictable) about experimenting with AI art tools."

    "title": "Using Gemini to Plan 4 Days in Spain",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Planning my time in Zaragoza, Spain\n\nMy parents, my grandma, and I are going to Spain in January and have not planned the portion of the trip where we are in Zaragoza. We are visiting my mom’s cousin there and want to hit the major landmarks. To help my mom plan, I decided to enlist Gemini to give us recommendations to look into. Here is the prompt I gave it\n\nI am planning a trip to Spain and have 4 days in Zaragoza. We already have accommodations in the city. We get there on January 18th in the afternoon and leave on the 22nd in the morning. I am not too familiar with the city so would like recommendations on how to fill our time there. Keep in mind we do not have a car but could potentially rent one. Any recommendations for what to inside and outside the city?\n\nHere was Gemini’s Response:\n\nDay 1: Arrival & The “El Tubo” Experience * Afternoon Arrival: Settle into your accommodation. If you are near the center, start with a walk to Plaza del Pilar, one of the largest pedestrian squares in Europe. * Evening: Head to El Tubo, a famous maze of narrow alleys filled with tapas bars. * Tip: Try the famous mushrooms at El Champi or the croquettes at Doña Casta.\nDay 2: Mudéjar Architecture & Roman Roots * Morning: Visit the Basilica del Pilar. It’s free to enter, but pay the small fee to take the elevator up the tower for the best panoramic view of the city and the Ebro River. * Late Morning: Walk 2 minutes to La Seo Cathedral. While the Basilica is more famous, many locals prefer La Seo for its stunning mix of Gothic and Mudéjar (Islamic-influenced) styles. * Afternoon: Follow the Roman Route. Zaragoza was the Roman city Caesaraugusta. Visit the Roman Theatre (the most impressive ruin) and the Forum Museum located underground.\nDay 3: The Aljafería & Modern Art * Morning: Aljafería Palace. This 11th-century Islamic palace is a UNESCO World Heritage site and arguably the most important Moorish building outside of Andalusia. * Note: It currently houses the regional parliament, so booking tickets online in advance is highly recommended. * Afternoon: Visit the Goya Museum. Francisco de Goya was born just outside the city, and this museum houses a significant collection of his engravings and paintings. * Alternative: If you prefer modern art, the IAACC Pablo Serrano is a striking building with great contemporary exhibits.\nDay 4: Day Trip (No Car Needed) You can easily see incredible sites outside the city using Spain’s efficient train (AVE) or bus network: * Option A: Alquézar (Bus/Tour): Often cited as one of Spain’s most beautiful medieval villages, famous for its “footbridges” walk along the river. * Option B: Monasterio de Piedra (Bus): A stunning natural park filled with waterfalls and a 12th-century monastery. There is a direct bus from the Zaragoza Delicias station that takes about 2 hours. * Option C: Belchite (Bus): For history buffs, the ruins of “Old Belchite” (destroyed in the Civil War) serve as a haunting “ghost town” memorial.\n\nI thought this was a great response. Gemini also offered to but the recommendations into a sheet so I clicked on it and it generated this sheet:\n\nThe sheet was not exactly that much more helpful but the overall recommendations were great. I especially liked the options for taking bus tours instead of renting a car. I think we will definitely look into booking the bus tour to the monastery and Alquézar because the pictures online look beautiful.\n \nI compared the output to TripAdvisor:\n\nBasílica de Nuestra Señora del Pilar\nPalacio de la Aljafería\nCatedral del Salvador (La Seo)\nPlaza del Pilar\nMuseo del Teatro de Caesaraugusta (Roman Theatre)\nAcuario de Zaragoza (Freshwater Aquarium)\nMuseo Goya - Colección Ibercaja\nParque Grande José Antonio Labordeta\nEl Tubo (The famous tapas district)\nPuente de Piedra (Stone Bridge)\nMercado Central de Zaragoza\nMuseo del Foro de Caesaraugusta (Roman Forum Museum)\n\nThere were some overlap but Gemini was also able to give me things to do outside of the city. Overall, as a tool to narrow down the overwhelming amount of information out there, Gemini was great. I got a lot of direct leads that saved me time and probably a lot of stress behind the wheel."

We’re ready for adventure and open to sleeping in the car for a couple of nights (if safe) and finding some budget-friendly stays along the way. We also want to squeeze in a day in San Diego and will stay with family in Oxnard, CA for a night or two.\nI used ChatGPT to help me plan the route, stops, and lodging options. Here’s how it went:\n\n\n\nI’m planning a road trip in California: I go to SFO in California on December 9th and will be leaving from the Bay on December 10th. We need to be at LAX airport by around 9am on December 17th. I’ll be traveling with one other person. We are willing to sleep in the car for a couple of nights (if the area is safe), but we’d also like to find relatively cheap places to stay overnight along the way. We also want to include a day-visit to San Diego if feasible, and we’ll stay for a night or 2 with family in Oxnard, CA. Please help me plan the route, suggest where to stop each night, safe car-sleep or cheap lodging tips, and how to budget for accommodation. Also highlight how to prompt you (the LLM) to get best results for road-trip planning.\n\n\n\n\nThe LLM gave me some images to start:\n\nThen outlined the trip it had planned:\n\n\n\nRoute shape: Bay Area → Monterey/Carmel (scenic stop) → US-101 via San Luis Obispo → Santa Barbara → Oxnard (family nights) → Los Angeles → San Diego day-trip → back to LA (sleep near LAX on 12/16).\nBig Sur caution: Highway 1 through Big Sur still has long-term closures; plan to enjoy the northern Big Sur viewpoints from Carmel/Monterey, then cut back to US-101 for the through-drive south. Always check Caltrans trip-day status. (SFGATE)\nCar-sleep rules: CA rest areas allow up to 8 hours; camping is prohibited. Look for posted “8 HOUR PARKING” signs (Caltrans/MUTCD). (Legal Information Institute)\nWalmart overnights: Allowed case-by-case by store manager (varies by city ordinances). Ask the specific store. (DAT)\nTrain option for San Diego: If you don’t want to fight I-5 traffic, the Amtrak Pacific Surfliner runs frequent LA↔︎SD trains (walkable stations). (Amtrak)\n\n\nDec 9 – Arrive SFO Crash wherever you’re staying in the Bay. If you want a budget SF option night-of: Hostelling International (dorms/private). (HI USA)\nDec 10 – Bay Area → Monterey/Carmel → San Luis Obispo/Pismo (sleep)\n\nMorning: Drive HWY-1 to Carmel, Point Lobos pull-offs, Bixby vista if open from the north (turn around before closures), then hop to US-101 via Salinas/Prunedale. (SFGATE)\nSleep (choose one):\n\nVery cheap car-camp (legal): CA rest area on US-101 (e.g., Camp Roberts near San Miguel) — max 8 hrs. (yelp.com)\nBudget motel in San Luis Obispo/Pismo (often $60–$120 range in December). (expedia)\n\n\nDec 11 – SLO/Pismo → Santa Barbara → Oxnard (family)\n\nRoll the coast on US-101. Afternoon in Santa Barbara; sunset in Channel Islands Harbor after you land in Oxnard. (channelislandsharbor.org)\nSleep: with family (1 of 1–2 free nights).\n\nDec 12 – Oxnard (family day)\n\nOptions: Harbor walk, kayak, or consider a Channel Islands boat if seas/coast weather look good (Island Packers runs park/ferry & wildlife trips). (Island Packers)\nSleep: with family (2 of 2 free nights, or just 1 if you prefer more LA time).\n\nDec 13 – Oxnard → Los Angeles (sleep)\n\nShort hop. Explore LA neighborhoods or beaches.\nSleep: budget motel/hostel in LA or a permitted rest area stop along a freeway outside dense neighborhoods if you want a second car-sleep night (observe posted limits). (Legal Information Institute)\n\nDec 14 – LA → San Diego (sleep in SD or return to LA) Two good ways:\n\nDrive I-5 early (2–3 hrs off-peak), or\nTrain Pacific Surfliner from LA Union Station → San Diego (walkable to transit/Balboa Park connections). (Amtrak)\n\n\nSD highlights for a single day: La Jolla Cove (sea lions/seals), Balboa Park, Old Town. (La Jolla is a protected area; keep a respectful distance from wildlife.) (Tripadvisor)\nSleep: Either inexpensive SD hostel/motel or back in LA (see budget section sources). (expedia)\n\nDec 15 – Back to LA (if you slept in SD)\n\nExtra LA sightseeing or beach day.\nSleep: LA area.\n\nDec 16 – Stage for LAX\n\nKeep this night near LAX/El Segundo so the 9am arrival on the 17th is easy. Choose a basic motel/airport hotel; car-sleep is not recommended near the airport due to city ordinances and parking enforcement.\nSleep: LAX-area lodging.\n\nDec 17 – Fly from LAX ~9am\n\nReturn the car and roll out.\n\n\nLegal, safe car-sleep options (max 2 nights total like you wanted):\n\nCaltrans Rest Areas (8-hr limit; not camping): Pull in late, leave early, use well-lit, busy facilities. Example on your route: Camp Roberts on US-101. (Legal Information Institute)\nSome Walmarts allow overnight by manager permission—always ask inside; varies by city. (DAT)\n\nUltra-budget paid stays:\n\nMunicipal campground: Veterans Memorial Park (Monterey) is first-come, first-served, inexpensive, and central for your 12/10 evening if you want a camp vibe.

We need to be at LAX airport by around 9am on December 17th. I’ll be traveling with one other person. We are willing to sleep in the car for a couple of nights (if the area is safe), but we’d also like to find relatively cheap places to stay overnight along the way. We also want to include a day-visit to San Diego if feasible, and we’ll stay for a night or 2 with family in Oxnard, CA.

Always check Caltrans trip-day status. (SFGATE)\nCar-sleep rules: CA rest areas allow up to 8 hours; camping is prohibited. Look for posted “8 HOUR PARKING” signs (Caltrans/MUTCD). (Legal Information Institute)\nWalmart overnights: Allowed case-by-case by store manager (varies by city ordinances). Ask the specific store. (DAT)\nTrain option for San Diego: If you don’t want to fight I-5 traffic, the Amtrak Pacific Surfliner runs frequent LA↔︎SD trains (walkable stations).

(HI USA)\nDec 10 – Bay Area → Monterey/Carmel → San Luis Obispo/Pismo (sleep)\n\nMorning: Drive HWY-1 to Carmel, Point Lobos pull-offs, Bixby vista if open from the north (turn around before closures), then hop to US-101 via Salinas/Prunedale. (SFGATE)\nSleep (choose one):\n\nVery cheap car-camp (legal): CA rest area on US-101 (e.g., Camp Roberts near San Miguel) — max 8 hrs. (yelp.com)\nBudget motel in San Luis Obispo/Pismo (often $60–$120 range in December). (expedia)\n\n\nDec 11 – SLO/Pismo → Santa Barbara → Oxnard (family)\n\nRoll the coast on US-101. Afternoon in Santa Barbara; sunset in Channel Islands Harbor after you land in Oxnard. (channelislandsharbor.org)\nSleep: with family (1 of 1–2 free nights).\n\nDec 12 – Oxnard (family day)\n\nOptions: Harbor walk, kayak, or consider a Channel Islands boat if seas/coast weather look good (Island Packers runs park/ferry & wildlife trips). (Island Packers)\nSleep: with family (2 of 2 free nights, or just 1 if you prefer more LA time).\n\nDec 13 – Oxnard → Los Angeles (sleep)\n\nShort hop. Explore LA neighborhoods or beaches.\nSleep: budget motel/hostel in LA or a permitted rest area stop along a freeway outside dense neighborhoods if you want a second car-sleep night (observe posted limits). (Legal Information Institute)\n\nDec 14 – LA → San Diego (sleep in SD or return to LA) Two good ways:\n\nDrive I-5 early (2–3 hrs off-peak), or\nTrain Pacific Surfliner from LA Union Station → San Diego (walkable to transit/Balboa Park connections).

(Tripadvisor)\nSleep: Either inexpensive SD hostel/motel or back in LA (see budget section sources). (expedia)\n\nDec 15 – Back to LA (if you slept in SD)\n\nExtra LA sightseeing or beach day.\nSleep: LA area.\n\nDec 16 – Stage for LAX\n\nKeep this night near LAX/El Segundo so the 9am arrival on the 17th is easy.

    "text": "Cutting hair is one of those things that seems simple until you’re the one actually holding the scissors. My roommate asked me to trim and layer her long, wavy hair and I told her I’d give it a go.\nSo naturally, I opened ChatGPT-5 and asked it how to guide me step-by-step.\n\n\n\n\nMy friend asked me to cut her hair. How would you recommend I do it? She has long hair that’s slightly wavy with layers\n\n\n\nChatGPT gave a beginner-friendly overview: tools needed, the “golden rules,” and a safe method using sectioning or the “unicorn cut.” It emphasized trimming very conservatively, keeping symmetry, and using point-cutting to soften the ends.\nIt told me not to use kitchen scissors. Unfortunately, those were the only scissors I had.\n\nI uploaded a picture of my roommate’s hair from the back. I clarified that I didn’t want to do the unicorn cut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don’t think I want to do a unicorn cut so I think I’ll section it and cut it.\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT analyzed the photo and confirmed:\nThe hair type (long, wavy)\nUneven ends\nRecommended a 3-section method\nTold me exactly how to trim the bottom, middle, and top sections safely\nIt was like having a virtual hairstylist supervise.\n\nI sent another picture after I clipped her hair into multiple sections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt outlined the steps to go from the current photo including what to do for the bottom, middle, and top sections and then doing the side + face-framing and cross-check. It also made the comment:\n\n\nJust keep these rules in mind:\n\nBottom = blunt(ish) trim\nMiddle = longest/softest layers\nTop = lightest, shortest layers\nPoint-cut everything except the bottom baseline\n\n\nIt adjusted its instructions based on the exact setup in the image.\n\nI did the length trim and sent another picture of the result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow I want to do layers.\n\n\n\n\nThis is where ChatGPT-5 really shined. It told me exactly how to layer based on the photo:\nRelease the middle section\nCut the “guide” layer\nElevate at 45°\nTrim only 1/2 inch\nUse vertical point-cutting to avoid harsh lines\nThen move to the top section and add only light layering\n\nThe layering was the part that I was most worried for but I followed the instructions and think my roommates hair turned out great!\nWould I trust ChatGPT to cut my own hair? … Probably not.\nWould I use it again to cut someone else’s hair? Absolutely."

    "title": "Comparing AI Detection Results on Different Models",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Comparing AI Detection Results on ChatGPT 5.0, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and local DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B.\nI gave the 3 models the same prompt: Explain how photosynthesis works in plants (3-5 sentences).\nI then used zeroGPT.com to analyze each of their responses. The results were as follows:\n\nChatGPT 5.0:\nPhotosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose (sugar) and oxygen. This takes place mainly in the chloroplasts of plant cells, where the green pigment chlorophyll absorbs light energy. The light energy powers chemical reactions that split water molecules, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. The glucose made provides energy and building material for the plant’s growth and survival.\nAI Detector Result:\n\nGemini 2.5 Flash:\nPhotosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy to create their own food. Plants absorb water through their roots and carbon dioxide (CO^2) through tiny pores in their leaves called stomata. Using chlorophyll to capture energy from sunlight, these raw materials are transformed into glucose (a sugar for energy) and oxygen (O^2). The oxygen is then released as a byproduct, making the process vital for life on Earth.\nAI Detector Result:\n\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B (did not keep it 3-5 sentences):\nPhotosynthesis is a process where plants convert sunlight into chemical energy to fuel their growth and survival. This occurs primarily in chloroplasts, which contain chlorophyll giving them their green color. The process consists of two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle.\nIn the light-dependent reactions (PSII), water molecules are split using ATP synthase, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This step also produces ATP and NADPH, energy carriers essential for the next stage.\nThe Calvin cycle (PC) involves fixing carbon dioxide into organic compounds through enzyme-driven reactions in the stroma of chloroplasts. Using ATP and NADPH, CO2 is converted into glucose, providing plants with the energy they need to grow and develop. This process ensures that plants can synthesize their own food using sunlight as an energy source.\nAI Detector Result:\n\n\nJust by copy and pasting the outputs from the models, the AI detector correctly identified each of the responses as 100% AI generated. However, I wanted to see what it would say about other likely non-AI generated responses. I went to Wikipedia and to National Geographic and copied the first couple lines of the article on photosynthesis. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis and https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/photosynthesis/).\nI also went to Quora and grabbed an explanation from 12 years ago (https://www.quora.com/What-is-photosynthesis-and-how-does-it-work).\n\nWikipedia:\nPhotosynthesis is a system of biological processes by which photopigment-bearing autotrophic organisms, such as most plants, algae and cyanobacteria, convert light energy — typically from sunlight — into the chemical energy necessary to fuel their metabolism. The term photosynthesis usually refers to oxygenic photosynthesis, a process that releases oxygen as a byproduct of water splitting. Photosynthetic organisms store the converted chemical energy within the bonds of intracellular organic compounds (complex compounds containing carbon), typically carbohydrates like sugars (mainly glucose, fructose and sucrose), starches, phytoglycogen and cellulose. When needing to use this stored energy, an organism's cells then metabolize the organic compounds through cellular respiration.\nAI Detector Result:\n\nNational Geographic:\nPhotosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create oxygen and energy in the form of sugar. During photosynthesis, plants take in carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) from the air and soil. Within the plant cell, the water is oxidized, meaning it loses electrons, while the carbon dioxide is reduced, meaning it gains electrons. This transforms the water into oxygen and the carbon dioxide into glucose. The plant then releases the oxygen back into the air, and stores energy within the glucose molecules.\nAI Detector Result:\n\nQuora:\nPhotosynthesis occurs in two stages. In the first stage, light-dependent reactions or light reactions capture the energy of light and use it to make the energy-storage molecules ATP (Adenosine Thiosulphate) and NADPH. During the second stage, the light-independent reactions use these products to capture and reduce carbon dioxide. Most organisms that utilize photosynthesis to produce oxygen use visible light to do so, although at least three use infrared radiation.\nAI Detector Result:\n\n\nBoth of the articles were also classified 100% as AI-generated. I am not convinced that these articles were actually written by AI, but there is potential they were. I am very confident that the Quora answer was not AI generated, given that it was posted 12 years ago, yet the detector found that it was almost 70% AI generated.\nOverall, I think this AI detector may be overconfident in its detection of AI vs. Human. In practice, this makes them unreliable for truly distinguishing between human and machine-written content."
