But when my sister showed ChatGPT a picture of her toilet and requested help fixing it, the LLM was able to troubleshoot and lead her to a solution.\nShe noticed that the left hinge on her TOTO toilet seat had come loose. Instead of searching through manuals or calling a plumber, she simply snapped a photo and asked ChatGPT: ‚ÄúThe left hinge here is loose, how do I fix?‚Äù\n\nChatGPT responded with clear, step-by-step instructions (plus additional information that I omitted):\n\nLift the hinge cover\nLocate the screw/bolt\nTighten the screw\nSnap the hinge cover back down\n\nShe successfully fixed her toilet!\nThis small exchange highlights that AI isn‚Äôt only for complex reasoning tasks ‚Äî it can also provide practical, accessible troubleshooting in everyday life."
