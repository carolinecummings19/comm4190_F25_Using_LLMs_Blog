    "text": "Testing Two AI Art Models: Gemini vs. Qwen Image\nI tried running the same prompts through two different image generation models — Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash and the open-source Flux.1-dev — just to see how they’d interpret the same ideas.\nFor the “cozy café on a rainy street corner” prompt, Gemini added people into the scene. They looked a little animated, almost hazy, which gave it a softer, storybook vibe. Flux.1-dev went the opposite direction: darker streets, no people, and warm glowing lights from inside the café. It felt moodier, maybe more atmospheric.\n \nThen I tried “a sunflower field in Van Gogh style.” Here Gemini really nailed the painterly feel — thick strokes, swirly textures, very recognizable Van Gogh energy. Flux.1-dev leaned more cartoon-like, but still clearly borrowed from Van Gogh’s palette and angle.\n \nIt’s worth noting that Flux.1-dev is open source, which means it’s more hackable, customizable, and shaped by the community. Gemini feels a bit more polished and accurate out of the box, but less flexible under the hood. Together, the differences highlight what’s exciting (and sometimes unpredictable) about experimenting with AI art tools."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Today I was reading my book, Superagency, on a plane ride where I had no service or WiFi.\nI came across a word that I didn’t know the meaning of: sacrosanct. A couple months ago I would have acknowledged that I didn’t know the word and kept reading because I did not have access to the internet, a dictionary, or ChatGPT to look up the word.\nHowever, today I remembered that I had gotten the GPT4All desktop app onto my computer last week and downloaded an LLM locally onto my computer: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B.\nI pulled out my computer with hopes that the model was truly runnable offline. To my joy, I opened the app and loaded the model into the chat.\n\nUser: What does the word sacrosanct mean?\nModel: “Sacrosanct” is an adjective that describes something of great importance or authority, often beyond human contestation. It comes from the Latin words “sacer” (meaning priest) and “sanctorum” (a sacred place). In religious contexts, it refers to things held in highest spiritual regard, such as the Eucharist in Christianity or the Kaaba in Islam.\n\nWow! I was so happy that I had this powerful tool at my fingertips to converse with high up in the sky.\nI kept my computer open while I continued to read and came across another word that I did not know:\n\nUser: What does the word equanimity mean?\nModel: Equanimity means emotional balance; calmness and composure, especially in difficult circumstances. It refers to being able to remain peaceful and unruffled despite challenges or stresses. For example, someone with equanimity might handle criticism gracefully or stay composed during a heated debate. Synonyms: calmness, composure, stability\nExamples: - The leader maintained equanimity even when the crisis escalated. - Her quiet demeanor suggested she had achieved a state of equanimity after years of struggle.\n\nThis time the model thought for 26 seconds before responding and I was able to see the chain of thought reasoning which I thought was very cool:\nAlright, the user asked about \"sacrosanct\" earlier and I explained it. \nNow they're asking about \"equanimity.\" \nThey might be studying vocabulary or preparing for an exam.\n\nI should provide a clear definition of equanimity. \nIt's important to explain that it means emotional balance without getting upset by things, \nespecially in tough situations.\n\nMaybe include some synonyms like calmness and composure to help them understand better. \nAlso, adding examples could make the explanation more concrete—like how people use it \nwhen dealing with stress or conflicts.\n\nI should keep the tone friendly but informative since they're likely looking \nfor a precise meaning without any fluff.\nThe last question I asked during my reading session was the following. The model thought for 60 seconds for this one! When I looked at the thought process, I realized that I had spelled “psychotherapies” wrong and it was trying to decipher my question.\n\nUser: What are some examples of pyschotherapies?\nModel: Here are some examples:\n\nCognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT): A widely used psychotherapeutic technique that focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors.\nDialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT): A therapy designed to help individuals with borderline personality disorder improve their interpersonal skills, reduce harmful behaviors, and manage symptoms of mental health disorders.\nEye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR): Also known as processing trauma, this technique uses eye movements combined with memory retrieval to treat post-traumatic stress symptoms.\n\nIf you meant something else by “psychotherapies,” please provide more context so I can give a more accurate response!\n\nOverall, I was really impressed by the models responses. I think it was especially cool that it provided the thought process explaination alongside the output like the frontier LLMs now do. I am excited to continue to explore its capabilities!"

    "text": "As I approach the end of my college career in Philadelphia, I’ve realized that while I’ve seen the major tourist highlights, there’s so much more to this city. I’ve walked past the Liberty Bell, admired the art at the PMA, and gotten lost in the mosaics of the Magic Gardens. But with only a few months left, I wanted to go beyond the postcard destinations and discover the unique, lesser-known spots that make Philly so special. So, I turned to an unconventional source for recommendations: an AI assistant named Gemini.\n\n\nA search for “Philly hidden gems” on Google yields countless articles, but they can be repetitive and sometimes feature places that are now quite popular. I wanted a curated list that took into account a massive amount of data and filter it based on my specific criteria—namely, that I’m a college student looking for unique experiences. I also wanted to see if an AI could understand the nuance of my request and provide genuinely helpful, non-obvious suggestions.\n\n\nGemini’s response was a pleasant surprise. It didn’t just rattle off a list of places; it categorized them into “Museums & Cultural Gems,” “Parks & Outdoor Spaces,” and “Unique Experiences.” This structure made the information easy to digest and prioritize.\n\n\n\n\nThe Mütter Museum: For something truly unique, this is a must-see. Located in the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, this museum is a fascinating and sometimes macabre collection of medical oddities, anatomical specimens, and antique medical instruments. It’s a journey into the history of medicine that is unlike any other museum experience.\nThe Barnes Foundation: While the PMA is a staple, the Barnes Foundation offers a different kind of art experience. It houses one of the world’s most significant collections of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist, and early Modern paintings, displayed exactly as Dr. Barnes arranged them. It’s an intimate and visually stunning collection.\nEastern State Penitentiary: A popular spot, but if you haven’t been, it’s a powerful and unique experience. This historic former prison is a hauntingly beautiful ruin with a rich history, including housing famous criminals like Al Capone. The audio tour provides an excellent and in-depth look at the prison’s past.\nShofuso Japanese House and Garden: Tucked away in Fairmount Park, this is a beautiful and serene escape from the city. The traditional 17th-century style Japanese house and its tranquil garden, complete with a koi pond and waterfall, offer a peaceful and reflective experience. It’s particularly stunning in the spring and fall.\nWagner Free Institute of Science: This museum is a perfectly preserved example of a Victorian-era natural history museum. The exhibits, which include over 100,000 specimens of fossils, minerals, and taxidermy, are displayed in their original wood and glass cases. It’s a step back in time and a fantastic hidden gem.\n\n\n\nBartram’s Garden: As the oldest surviving botanical garden in North America, this is a beautiful and historic spot on the banks of the Schuylkill River. It’s a perfect place for a walk, a picnic, and to learn about the history of American botany.\nThe Rail Park: Philadelphia’s version of New York’s High Line, this is an elevated park built on a former train line. It’s a great spot for a walk with unique views of the city’s post-industrial landscape.\nCira Green: A park on top of a parking garage. It’s a great spot to relax, have a picnic, and enjoy a unique and free view of the city skyline, especially at sunset.\nLaurel Hill Cemetery: While a cemetery might seem like an unusual suggestion, this is a 78-acre National Historic Landmark and the nation’s second oldest cemetery. It’s a beautiful, sprawling park with incredible Victorian-era monuments and stunning views of the Schuylkill River.\n\n\n\nBok Bar: If it’s the right season (April to October), head to the top of the former Bok Vocational High School in South Philly. This seasonal bar offers an incredible rooftop view of the city skyline and is a great spot to grab a drink and hang out with friends.\nSouth Street Headhouse District: You’ve been to the Magic Gardens, but explore the rest of the neighborhood. South Street is known for its eclectic shops, diverse restaurants, and vibrant murals. It’s a great place to wander and people-watch.\nThe Italian Market: America’s oldest outdoor market. The street is a feast for the senses, with vendors selling fresh produce, meats, cheeses, and a variety of Italian and other ethnic foods. It’s a bustling and authentic Philadelphia experience.\nWalk or Bike the Schuylkill River Trail: The Schuylkill Banks Boardwalk offers a beautiful path over the water with a unique perspective of the city. You can walk, run, or bike for miles and explore different parts of the city’s riverfront.\nExplore Local Neighborhoods: Spend some time wandering through neighborhoods like Fishtown for its vibrant arts and music scene, East Passyunk for its amazing food, or Queen Village for its charming, historic streets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recommendations were not only accurate but also thoughtfully tailored to my request. It provided a list that delved into the more authentic, local-centric experiences that I was looking for. Its ability to suggest a range of activities, from the macabre to the serene, and from hidden museums to vibrant neighborhoods, shows that it can synthesize information in a way that’s genuinely useful.\nAlthough I had already visited quite a few places on this list, there are plenty of options to choose from that I have not been to before like the Mütter Museum or the Barnes Foundation, Shofuso Japanese House and Garden or the Rail Park.\nI now have a fantastic itinerary for my last few months, and I’m looking forward to crossing these unique spots off my Philadelphia bucket list."

    "text": "I wanted to see how well ChatGPT 5 could improvise in the kitchen. Instead of asking for a standard recipe, I gave it a list of what I had on hand in my pantry and requested a simple recipe using only the ingredients I gave it.\n\n\n\n\nHere’s what I told ChatGPT I had available:\n\nFlour\n\nWhite sugar\nBrown sugar\nPowdered sugar\nEggs\n\nVegan butter\n\nVanilla extract\n\nCocoa powder\nBaking powder\nBaking soda\nChocolate chips\nCornstarch\nSoy milk\nHalf a container of strawberries\nRolled oats\nQuick oats\nYeast\nCinnamon\nSalt\n\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT gave me THREE options! It gave me options for One-Bowl Cocoa Brownies, Strawberry Oat Crisp, and Chewy Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies. I decided to try out the first brownie recipe:\n\n🍫 Option 1: One-Bowl Cocoa Brownies (Dairy-Free)\nIngredients\n\n½ cup vegan butter, melted\n1 cup white sugar (or half white, half brown for chewiness)\n2 eggs\n1 tsp vanilla extract\n½ cup cocoa powder\n½ cup flour\n¼ tsp baking powder\n¼ tsp salt\n½ cup chocolate chips\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease or line an 8x8 pan (or use any oven-safe dish, even a round cake pan).\nIn a bowl, whisk melted vegan butter and sugar. Add eggs and vanilla, whisk until smooth.\nSift in cocoa, flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir gently until just combined.\nFold in chocolate chips.\nSpread into the pan and bake 20–25 minutes, until edges are set and the center is slightly fudgy.\nCool, slice, enjoy!\n\n\n\n\n\nI followed ChatGPT’s recipe (with a little improvisation because I realized I didn’t have vanilla extract). The result? Pretty solid brownies! They were rich, chocolatey, and definitely satisfied my sweet tooth.\n \nI will say I had to cook it for an additional 10 minutes than the recipe called for. And they did not come out of the pan very nicely and kind of crumbled. But they were tasty!\n\n\n\nI don’t think I trust ChatGPT as much as a recipe that has reviews and has been tried and test but it was convenient to have it customized to ingredients I had in my pantry. I think I would use it again to come up with a recipe I need in a pinch because it could save time looking through recipes and seeing if I have all the ingredients.\n\n\n\nFor me, it won’t replace an actual cookbook or a trained baker anytime soon, but it’s surprisingly handy for quick, low-effort ideas when you don’t feel like scrolling through food blogs.\nNext time, I might try giving it weirder ingredients to see just how creative it gets."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I have heard of some of my friends using ChatGPT as a tool to talk to and vent their feelings. So, I was already under the assumptions that people were using LLMs as therapists.\nIn my book Superagency, I was excited to read about how there are models being built specifically as therapists. However, Reid Hoffman highlights the failure of the specialized LLM, Woebot, to be emotionally attuned. Specifically, he gives this example:\nWoebot: Okay, want to tell me more about what’s going on?\n\nUser: I’m feeling weird. It’s like I’m empty inside. When I look at the faces of my friends and family, I feel like they are empty as well. That’s why we cannot connect with each other. There’s nothing to hold on to.\n\nWoebot: Sounds like you are dealing with feeling low…\nThat seemed a bit crass. In my experience, I thought of ChatGPT to be more adept so I wanted to test that same conversation with the 5.0 version to see if it responded in a similar way.\n\nUser: I’m feeling weird. It’s like I’m empty inside. When I look at the faces of my friends and family, I feel like they are empty as well. That’s why we cannot connect with each other. There’s nothing to hold on to.\nChatGPT: That sounds really heavy—and lonely. You’re noticing not only a kind of emptiness in yourself, but also projecting that sense onto the people around you, which must make it feel even harder to connect. Almost like everyone’s faces become hollow and there’s no anchor, no solid ground to hold onto.\nI want you to know you’re not alone in feeling that way, even if it feels isolating. Sometimes those kinds of feelings can come with exhaustion, depression, or even just moments of disconnection where things lose their color and meaning.\nI’m here with you in this moment. Can I ask—when did you first start noticing this sense of emptiness?\n\n\nI thought this was a well-crafted response. In this test, I shared a heavy feeling of emptiness and disconnection with both Woebot and ChatGPT. Woebot’s reply felt generic and surface-level, simply labeling my mood as “feeling low” without much reflection. ChatGPT’s response, by contrast, directly acknowledged the depth of my experience, mirrored my words back to me, and gently normalized the feeling. It also invited me to explore when these feelings began, making the exchange feel more empathetic and human."

Hiring a coach can be expensive, and online plans are usually one-size-fits-all.\nSo, I decided to experiment: what if ChatGPT 5 could be my running coach?\n\n\n\nI wanted to have the final plan customized for me based on my current fitness and lifestlye. I started off by asking ChatGPT 5 what sort of information it wanted from me in order to make my training plan.\n\nUser: I want you to be my running coach to help me train for the 2025 Philadelphia Marathon which is in 2 months. Can you give me a list of questions that you would ask me in order to formulate a customized training plan for me?\n\nChatGPT: Perfect! To create a customized 2-month training plan for the 2025 Philadelphia Marathon, I’d want to get a full picture of your background, goals, lifestyle, and constraints. Here’s a list of questions I’d ask you as your “coach”:\n🏃 Running Background\n\nWhat is your current weekly mileage?\nWhat’s the longest run you’ve completed recently?\nHave you ever run a marathon before? If so, what was your time/experience like?\nDo you have recent race times for shorter distances (5K, 10K, half marathon)?\nDo you typically run on roads, tracks, or trails?\n\n🎯 Goals & Expectations\n\nWhat is your primary goal for the Philadelphia Marathon — finish strong, hit a specific time, or qualify for something (e.g., Boston)?\nDo you have a target pace in mind for race day?\nWhat’s more important to you: speed, endurance, or simply enjoying the experience?\n\n🏋️ Strength & Cross Training\n\nDo you currently do strength training or cross training (cycling, swimming, yoga, etc.)?\nAre you open to incorporating strength/mobility sessions into your plan?\n\n⏰ Schedule & Lifestyle\n\nHow many days per week can you realistically commit to running?\nDo you prefer morning, afternoon, or evening runs?\nDo you have any upcoming travel, work, or school commitments that may affect training?\n\n🩺 Health & Injury History\n\nHave you had any past or current injuries (knees, shins, ankles, hips, etc.)?\nDo you have any health concerns I should keep in mind (e.g., asthma, anemia, nutrition issues)?\n\n🥗 Fueling & Recovery\n\nHow’s your nutrition and hydration routine right now?\nDo you have experience practicing fueling (gels, chews, hydration) on long runs?\nHow many hours of sleep do you typically get per night?\n\n🌦 Race-Day Specifics\n\nHave you run in Philadelphia before, or are you familiar with the marathon course?\nDo you have gear preferences (shoes, watch, hydration belt/vest)?\n\n💡 Personal Motivation\n\nWhat motivates you most: following a structured plan, listening to your body, or running with others?\nWhat do you hope to get out of this marathon beyond just finishing (confidence, health, community, fun)?\n\n\nIt gave me 22 questions to answer! I answered each of them to the best of my ability with hopes of having a very in-depth and tailored training plan.\n\n\n\n8-Week Philadelphia Marathon Training Plan\n(Starting Monday, Sept 15, 2025 → Race Day Sunday, Nov 23, 2025)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nM\nT\nW\nTh\nF\nS\nS\n\n\n\n\n1 (Sept 15)\nRest / XT\n6 mi easy\n5 mi w/ strides\n6 mi @ MP (8:00–8:15)\nRest\n4 mi shakeout\nHalf Marathon Race\n\n\n2 (Sept 22)\nRest\n14 mi long run\n6 mi aerobic\n6 x 1k @ 10K pace\nRest\n6 mi easy\n5 mi recovery\n\n\n3 (Sept 29)\nRest\n7 mi easy\n5 mi tempo (HM pace)\n7 mi aerobic\nRest\n5 mi easy\n16 mi long run (last 4 @ MP)\n\n\n4 (Oct 6)\nRest\n8 mi aerobic\n8 x 800m @ 10K pace\n6 mi easy\nRest\n6 mi easy\n18 mi long run\n\n\n5 (Oct 13)\nRest\n7 mi easy\n6 mi tempo (HM pace)\n8 mi aerobic\nRest\n6 mi easy\n20 mi long run (last 6 @ MP)\n\n\n6 (Oct 20)\nRest\n18 mi long run (last 5 @ MP)\n6 mi aerobic\n10 x 400m @ 5K pace\nRest\n6 mi easy\n5 mi recovery\n\n\n7 (Oct 27)\nRest\n7 mi easy\n5 mi tempo (HM pace)\n6 mi aerobic\nRest\n5 mi easy\n14 mi long run\n\n\n8 (Nov 3)\nRest\n10 mi long run\n6 mi aerobic\n6 x 800m @ 10K pace\nRest\n4 mi shakeout\n5 mi recovery\n\n\n9 (Nov 10)\nRest\n5 mi easy\n4 mi tempo\n5 mi aerobic\nRest\n4 mi shakeout\n8 mi long run\n\n\n10 (Nov 17)\nRest\n4 mi easy\n3 mi w/ strides\n3 mi easy\nRest\n2 mi shakeout\nRACE DAY! 26.2 mi\n\n\n\nKey: - MP = Marathon Pace (8:00–8:15/mi) - Tempo = Half Marathon pace (~7:55–8:00/mi) - Intervals = 10K pace (~7:40–7:50/mi) or 5K pace (~6:55–7:05/mi) - Easy/aerobic runs = comfortable conversational pace (~9:00–9:30/mi) - Long runs include fueling practice + hydration - Rest = rest day or optional cross training (bike, swim, yoga)\n\n\n\nThis experiment showed me how AI can make training feel more accessible.\nWhile it won’t replace years of coaching expertise, it’s a surprisingly motivating and structured tool.\nFor now, ChatGPT is my new running buddy — and hopefully, it’ll help me cross the finish line in Philadelphia this fall."

I answered each of them to the best of my ability with hopes of having a very in-depth and tailored training plan.\n\n\n\n8-Week Philadelphia Marathon Training Plan\n(Starting Monday, Sept 15, 2025 → Race Day Sunday, Nov 23, 2025)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nM\nT\nW\nTh\nF\nS\nS\n\n\n\n\n1 (Sept 15)\nRest / XT\n6 mi easy\n5 mi w/ strides\n6 mi @ MP (8:00–8:15)\nRest\n4 mi shakeout\nHalf Marathon Race\n\n\n2 (Sept 22)\nRest\n14 mi long run\n6 mi aerobic\n6 x 1k @ 10K pace\nRest\n6 mi easy\n5 mi recovery\n\n\n3 (Sept 29)\nRest\n7 mi easy\n5 mi tempo (HM pace)\n7 mi aerobic\nRest\n5 mi easy\n16 mi long run (last 4 @ MP)\n\n\n4 (Oct 6)\nRest\n8 mi aerobic\n8 x 800m @ 10K pace\n6 mi easy\nRest\n6 mi easy\n18 mi long run\n\n\n5 (Oct 13)\nRest\n7 mi easy\n6 mi tempo (HM pace)\n8 mi aerobic\nRest\n6 mi easy\n20 mi long run (last 6 @ MP)\n\n\n6 (Oct 20)\nRest\n18 mi long run (last 5 @ MP)\n6 mi aerobic\n10 x 400m @ 5K pace\nRest\n6 mi easy\n5 mi recovery\n\n\n7 (Oct 27)\nRest\n7 mi easy\n5 mi tempo (HM pace)\n6 mi aerobic\nRest\n5 mi easy\n14 mi long run\n\n\n8 (Nov 3)\nRest\n10 mi long run\n6 mi aerobic\n6 x 800m @ 10K pace\nRest\n4 mi shakeout\n5 mi recovery\n\n\n9 (Nov 10)\nRest\n5 mi easy\n4 mi tempo\n5 mi aerobic\nRest\n4 mi shakeout\n8 mi long run\n\n\n10 (Nov 17)\nRest\n4 mi easy\n3 mi w/ strides\n3 mi easy\nRest\n2 mi shakeout\nRACE DAY! 26.2 mi\n\n\n\nKey: - MP = Marathon Pace (8:00–8:15/mi) - Tempo = Half Marathon pace (~7:55–8:00/mi) - Intervals = 10K pace (~7:40–7:50/mi) or 5K pace (~6:55–7:05/mi) - Easy/aerobic runs = comfortable conversational pace (~9:00–9:30/mi) - Long runs include fueling practice + hydration - Rest = rest day or optional cross training (bike, swim, yoga)\n\n\n\nThis experiment showed me how AI can make training feel more accessible.\nWhile it won’t replace years of coaching expertise, it’s a surprisingly motivating and structured tool.\nFor now, ChatGPT is my new running buddy — and hopefully, it’ll help me cross the finish line in Philadelphia this fall."
